 flat surface  don't try holding your scales before you measure so m- I'm measuring my sugar two hundred and fifty grams it's good to start your mixer on a low on a low speed then you gradually increase it to a high speed but it's better you start even if you are using your hand mixer start it on a low speed then you gradually increase it so our butter and sugar is now properly creamed so we'll switch off our mixer then raise up a mixer you can see our butter and sugar is properly creamed for you to know whether your butter and sugar is properly cream it will be white and will fluffy  you can see compared to the colour of erm butter is white so when your your margarine butter is white and it's fluffy you can't feel the sugar so much and it's not heavy it's light you can see it's very light that's when y- how to know that your cake are creamed properly so the next thing we're going do now is get our eggs and flour ready I told you for this recipe for madeira sponge cake is equal butter to equal sugar to equal flour to equal eggs five eggs is equal to two hundred and fifty grams so in cracking your eggs get a clean bowl and break and the last egg so my eggs is ready the- I have to go back to the scale and measure my flour I'm measuring two hundred and fifty grams of flour don't forget always check at eye level so that you will be sure you have accurate measurement check at eye level here that's two hundred and fifty grams of flour you might be wondering what about the oil the milk the brown sugar the cocoa powder for the purpose of this edition we are making a plain we are making a madeira sponge cake so we don't need the brown sugar and all that erm I just brought them to show you all other ingredients you would need to make your cake so on subsequent editions I'll be showing you how to finish up your creaming then how to bake your cake so until then I'm Mojisola Egbeyemi now I'm sure at one time or another you've had to buy a gift for someone you love or even someone you don't love you know and you've had to wrap up that gift because it's part of the suspect you want the person to take off the wrapper take off the ribbon before you know the gift just springs  out  you know at the person so we are going to be talking about  gift wrapping how do you wrap that gift to make it look appealing you know even if it's only five hundred naira you could wrap it in such a way that's like wo o I want to see what is in there well if erm the person is disappointed at the end of the day too bad but she  must have enjoyed  and appreciated erm the wrapping okay yes gift-wrapping is going to be the topic  in the weeks to come and if you're a regular viewer you know that next week I'm gonna introduce the materials that we need  for gift-wrapping so get your pen paper ready and any material that you already know is used in gift-wrapping just bring them out  and I'm sure we'll add one or two to that list I'm not only wrapping gifts you know when you have to give a gift a present to somebody it could be very very lucrative you know if you own a gift shop you may want to learn how to wrap  you know gifts professionally  you'll find that there will be a boost in your sales for gift wrappers for the wrappers because the people will buy the wrappers and then want you to wrap them up but if you don't know how to wrap properly they just take their gifts you know  elsewhere so that could be a plus if you are a gift shop owner you know and then if you don't own a gift shop erm you could wrap gifts professionally like now the Yorubas have a you know culture where they bring you know gifts to their in-laws and present them on the erm engagement day if you know how ge- wrap gifts professionally you could just make you know a business out of that people just call you up you don't need a shop you don't need you know any extra hands you wouldn't need a car they just call you up oh Missis Lagbaja erm we're having erm an

some sellotape hey you better watch me next week so till then I remain yours truly Betty Clark bye bye today we're starting the topic gift-wrapping gift-wrapping and in case you're just joining us you're watching the DIY segment on every women's world and I'm your regular host or hostess Betty now we go straight  to business in front of me we have some of the basic materials you can use  in gift- wrapping so if you join me on the table we'll take a look at them this is wrapping paper see I've already cut part of this this is wrapping paper and this is roll this particular wrapping paper comes in rolls some of you might be used to the sheet wrapping paper that just comes in erm sheets whatever whether  it's the roll or the sheet it will wrap okay so wrapping paper this is also used for wrapping it's called sellowrap or sellowrapper I'm sure you've seen it it's used a lot during Christmas time to cover hampers okay and it comes erm with different motifs on it so the motif on this one is just you know little stars you have polka dot you have stripes and they come in different colours okay but I erm strongly advise especially for people that are just starting up to go for white coz white is neutral and you can buy a whole roll this is you know how it usually comes okay rolls like this so you can buy a roll of white and you can now use your ribbons to bring out whatever the colour combination is because if you decide to buy this maybe with a pink motif or a green motif on it well you have  erm you know when you want to wrap a colour erm gift sorry that is not green you know it might
    should know I love her", is wrong. The Bible points out the 
love people and
and I love meeting people
home for tourist people always love coming around 
part then these are the flap so after cutting you can easily fold can you see what I'm doing I'm gonna use the stapler to make it you know but ideally you should use erm your Uhu to make it very neat can you see I'm just folding in the flaps and you glue them down but I'm stapling because of time can you see so can even see that even though it's not you know to to accurate measure you can get the idea now I I I left out something before you fold before you fold you will now take your wrapping paper and you will glue your wrapping paper on top of the cardboard you will glue it so that is becomes one then you now fold it and when you fold it this what you have okay so this part is covered this is what this is inside of  our cardb- of the box this is card- the other side of the cardboard you can see it's plain we've used the wrapping paper to cover the opposite side and then  you have your lid okay let's see this one alright so this fits snuggly then you can use your paper ribbon and whatever to decorate it make bows and all that okay and then you have your gift box right so with that come to the end of our gift box segment topic alright so you I'm sure you're thinking of who you'll give a gift to I wouldn't mind receiving one alright till I come your way next week with something very very very interesting trust me Betty Clark signing off bye bye welcome my name is Betty and you're watching the DIY segment  on Every Woman's World last week we concluded the topic gift-wrapping gift boxes and I made a lovely gift box out of an  old discarded carton  you wouldn't believe it but it's very true now what does Betty have in store for us well it's something very simple to make something very interesting to look at something very erm fun okay and its something that can decorate your home or can decorate your table can decorate your shelves can decorate that little corner in your house or in your office they're called table toppers yeah table toppers and as the name implies  they go on a table or any flat surface they're decorative they're colourful they're bright they're attractive you can give them out as house-warming gifts you can use them to decorate you know an office you can use them to decorate your s- shop they're simply decorative fun to make very easy to make and people will love them if you give them out as a gift okay so I begin to whet your creative appetites next week we are going to do table toppers
 it's about the same thing it has a very bold pendant to make it look very rich I want to make vegetable stew and I'm using what we call gbure gbure erm in English is waterleaf so we have to slice theref- we have to slice the vegetable and I'm going to mix the gbure which is the waterleaf with a little leaf of scent leaf which we call efirin so you will slice the vegetables trying to slice the vegetable now the gbure which is the waterleaf after slicing it going to pour it hmm salty water to remove the dirt and to kill the germs going to use this to take rice tomorrow morning you can use erm you can use chicken you can use turkey you can use fish to cook this type of s- erm stew but I'm going to use smoked fish to make it I'm finish cutting the my gbure now I'm going to soa- soak it in in erm salt water to remove sand and any germ that might be attached to the leaf this is salt then I'll slice the the scent leaf which we call efirin just a little quantity efirin by the Yorubas is good for tummy is used for erm if a child has tummy ache you can you squeeze it and give the child the water to drink so I'm just going to add little efirin to it and then it give scent can you can perceive the odour aha so this also I put I can put it in there since I'm going to use the two together it doesn't matter I just mix it in there now I want to make the sauce the pepper sauce for it now you making the pepper sauce I'm going to slice my my onions slice my onions depends on the quantity of what you're making and how you want the onions to be some people can put much onions some can put little depending on their own taste so I'm finished slicing my onions get a clean pot I'm going to cook it with erm palm oil that the Yorubas call epo pupa so I allow the pot to dry a little then I'll pour my palm oil you can use vegetable oil but I'm not going to use vegetable oil I'm going to use palm oil while I wait for that I'm going to pound a little crayfish I don't use maggi because of the health effect of maggi I'm going to use crayfish and erm locust beans is a local seasoning it's erm we call it iru in Yoruba land but in English is called locust beans I have a plastic mortar that I will use in pounding the crayfish so the crayfish will star as my maggi because I don't want to use maggi for health reasons and also in the olden days our foreparents don't know what maggi is  they use all this locust and other les- local spices to make their own food and it tastes lovely so I'll I'll put my palm oil now depending on the quality of palm oil you also want you can make it little you can make it much depending on how oily you want the food to be I'm not going to add much I don't want it to be too oily I'll just add a little I like to bleach a little and I'll pour my onions I'll pour my onions it is a little bit bleached I'm not going to bleach it because if you bleach it you'll have destroyed the vitamin palm oil has a lot of vitamin A that is good for the eyes just like your locust beans so you don't allow it to bleach if not you've destroyed the nutrient you are killing it from it I've poured my onions allow it to steam in it for some few minutes then I'm gon- I'm going to pour my ground pepper tomato sauce this is crayfish have you ever taken crayfish tasted crayfish before okay you can have a taste of it you can take one or two you chew it careful it's tasty it's in the vegetable you had the other day is a sea food is a sea food very rich in iodine is good for goitre prevent goitre when you take a lot of sea food because it does have little particles you know the local people that make it they make it by the sea side and you know is usually very sandy so you could have some sand particles so for me not to have sand in my food I will sieve it a little I'll sieve it before I pound it you can either blow it or you put it in a sieve I'll bring out a sieve a small sieve this is a small sieve so so just sieve it slightly particles in there they fall off if there is any dirt inside because the sieve has holes it will drop off I can pound now put it in my small mortar and pound it the onions is not fried to my taste so I'll leave it for some few minutes again when is fried to my taste then I'll add my salt but while I'll do that I'm going to wash my fish now I told you I'm using smoked fish for it I just brought it out from the freezer so I'll wash it clean it off remove the head the the bones to make it ready this is a smoked fish is called panla panla so is okay now I'm going to add my pepper so you cover to steam try and wash the fish remove the heads and coz it's a smoked fish try and remove the bones for an adult you can cook it whole like this but because children will eat out of this so that it doesn't hurt them try and remove the bones taste it is still frozen so then I can wash my I can wash my vegetable now I can see sand s- see sand because I added salt so that it will make the sand inside it to settle at the base and ther- there's a bowl wash it thoroughly so I wash it one more time this is small let me bring out a bigger sieve so I can just pour it once inside of  so you allow to drain water I'm supposed to have my fish now so since I can't break it I need to pour it like that just remove the head and pour it ? we're going to leave for we're going to leave for because it's smoked fish that's why I'm putting it early so that it can absorb the the erm stew well if not you'll you'll feel the taste of raw fish in your mouth the the the pepper would not have gone in to give it a very good taste so with this now it will erm soak in well and you'll be able to enjoy your meal let me take this hmm welcome to the beauty tip segment of every woman's world my name is Simisola Akinsanya erm this week we'll be accessorising our laali and erm what we need for that is our glitters our studs brushes and all of that so erm let me show you some of the materials we will be the needing for accessorising our laali these are beautiful studs we have the we have different colours of that so we'll be using that for our accessorising and erm we have the dry glitters this is what it looks like they come in different colours this is golden yellow we have them in green blue depends on what colour you want then erm the tweezers I'm sure most of you will be like what would she be doing with tweezers is she pulling off her brows no I'll be needing my tweezers to pick up my studs then we'll be needing the glue here is my glue and I think that's about all we need to accessorise our laali I have my model here she was here last week her name is Julia hello Julia okay I hope you're ready to accessorise your laali this week she was here last week and this is the same laali we had last week so I'll be accessorising this laali erm Ju- Julia is wearing pink so I think I will be accessorising her laali with pink studs and all of that and I've already mentioned the things we need so the first thing we need to do is to make sure that the surface of our laali is clean very clean clear of erm dirts and all of that so I have a clean surface here already s- I need to erm let me quickly search for a pink stud yes I found one erm okay I'm gonna mix it with fuchsia pink  anyway to make it look trendy and more attractive okay yeah so I have my two studs ready for me all you need to do when you are accessorising your laali erm you just have to be very very careful of the location where you want to keep your studs really so what I'm trying to say  is we look for areas where our studs can stay all day especially if you are going out for a night outing I think it's very very nice when you're going out for a night outing to accessorise your laali so it can glitter on your finger so I've added a bit of erm glue so I just use my tweezers to pick one of my studs and attach it to where my glue is waiting okay yep so that's that you press on it so it can stick well to the skin so that whenever you move your hands you won't have it fall off easily so I think I will be accessorising this other part of the henna erm okay this corner so I'll just put a bit of glue just a bit of it you don't really need to put too much of it on your skin so I'll have the fuchsia okay the pink stud yeah yeah I don't wanna have too much of it on so it won't be so so obvious or or it won't look so over accessorised so now that I have my two studs I can now finish the whole accessorisation by adding a bit of glitter around it yeah just a bit of it you don't have to put so much especially if you're gonna appear under light or you're going out for a night outing I think this will look really cool yeah now I can now finish the whole thing up my spray my laali so it can look shiny yeah because my fingers or our fingers are very very very friendly to the skin you can always use your finger to massage it in nicely and that's it that is just it you don't have to use like an hour to accessorise your laali doesn't take too long at all and it's very very very very easy and that is that just take a look I hope you like this it goes with what Julia is wearing anyway she's wearing a pink top and she's got glitters all over her erm henna so I think this will go out Julia do you like it you love it because goes with your top anyway so this is how to accessorise your laali you can swing your hand you can do whatever you know swing and let them know it's it's well attached so you can do whatever with your hand it's well accessorised just take a deep look and see we still have all the accessories in ? hope you like it that is all about accessorising we don't have too much attached to accessorising our laali all you need is your glitters your studs and all that your tweezers don't forget your tweezers it will help you pick your stones easily so that is all about accesorising our laali erm but next week I'll be coming with another bunch of package I think I'll be working on the nails next week so be just stay tuned and be ready for me I'll see you next week bye hi I love it fuchsia pink here before you decide to wire a house you must be able to determine what and what items you need in a  particular area on a particular spot that would give you the the mind and the the the the insight of the kind of wire the size of wire you will use in a particular corner for a particular thing like where you will put your air conditioners the wire you use there will not be the same size like where you are plugging just a minor electronics so that you will record first that you will find out first then you will also have to know that in wiring you have what is called positive and negative cords and also in wire too you have erm single cord and multiple cords the multiple cords and single cords and they also have gauge you have to know the gauge you want to use one M M two M M three M M four M M as as much higher erm whatever you're plugging like air condition conditioner cannot use something of one M M as one millimetre or two no y- you start from something like three up so that is about that then when you know that you now know that there is positive there is negative the positive lines are where you put the the lines that work the negative goes more or less like hearts so that's the minor side of the electricity so when you know that you make sure that you're connecting your socket switch the area that holds that switch that goes off and on that is where you put your red wire which is the positive so that by the time you off it the light is off there and not more nothing more will remain unless you on it again so that is it by the time you're connecting there is what we call junction box where you make your connection that one the one that is coming out to the switch the one that is coming from the supply erm change over will be that is where you make your connections and you make sure that no one bridges with the other no one comes across the other they have to be in a separate ways to avoid sparking and then fire will now come so that is all about wiring and wiring you also make sure that you there's what you call clip are used to clip your wires on the wall is of different types you have rubber you have the thread type you have the other one like erm iron type depending on the size of wire you are using mostly common the common one is the the little one the rubber one that's from one M M to three M M that's the one that comes often the bigger ones is always within the changeover side and the and the service wire that comes form the NePA side that's where you use the bigger ones is not often but when you talk about the house wiring domestic you use high highest one you use is three M M yes because a house there m- there there may not be quite different things office and a house they are more or less alike but when you talk about factory is quite different but which one do you use mostly okay okay so it means wiring in a house and wiring an office they are quite different things okay okay I have erm  potatoes here this is Irish potatoes  and I want to just peal it  after pealing it I will wash it  and then  I'll slice it after slicing then I can now  put my groundnut oil on the fire  when it is hot I can now  put salt on the sliced  erm  potatoes  and then I'll be able to  fry it  okay we have erm  Irish potatoes  which is this  particular one that I'm using  and then  we have what is called the sweet potatoes  the sweet potatoes are bigger  they are not as erm small as this ones they're bigger than the Irish potatoes and they're sweet  they taste like sugar you know when you fry or boil or you make  porridge or whatever you make out of it  so for this one  it is erm  just the same species just one species Irish  that's all  so  that's the one I want to use  no this is not the common one here erm in Jos  you produce this just in Jos  it produces only  it is being produced only in Jos you can't find it anywhere in the part of this country  only in Jos  yeah you get but the sweet potatoes I think you can find it in Ado you can find it  in every other place  so I will just on my gas  and put my groundnut oil  so that  I can fry it now that I have my potatoes fe- pealed so I put my pot on the fire or you can use your frying pan because the pot is wet now I'll allow it to dry off  then I will now put the groundnut oil and when the groundnut oil is hot enough let me slice some small onions no it's not for the potatoes it's for the groundnut oil  because I want to have a very you know good  smell of groundnut oil I don't want it to smell anyhow  so I want my groundnut oil to  have a good smell  I've poured my groundnut oil inside  so let me allow it to just be a bit hot   when it's a bit hot I can now slice in my  onions  the onions help it to have a different you know aroma  fe- coz some of the groundnut oil  they're not very good they smell  they have a bad odour  so I don't want it inside yes  so I'm just slicing my  onions inside the  groundnut oil  now that the g- erm onions are already fried I can  put some salt  inside my  I can add my salt inside the potatoes  just a pinch of salt and then I turn it up so that everywhere gets it so I'll pour in my potatoes inside the frying pan after the hot groundnut oil  good  so I will now allow it to fry for  some  ten minutes  and then it will be done when it is done I will just remove it  and put it in the plate and I can fry some eggs  just have a good breakfast that's erm  that's what I take for breakfast  no in Jos in Plateau state yes a typical breakfast in Jos because it is being produced in Jos so it is cheaper most people have their potato chips  as breakfast  and if you have money you want to eat with eggs  you buy your eggs and then you fry it  and the potatoes is not just  frying  some people boil it  yes you can just boil it  ahem excuse me and eat it with erm  sauce maybe a stew or you make a small sauce and eat or soup or something  and then some people also  instead of boiling  you make into a jollof pottage you know ahem so  you have different ways of doing it and then some people also just boil it and then mash it   so you have mashed potatoes erm and all that so  is a variety  is a very special food for Plateau people they love it  yes that's the one I said mashed  yes instead of pounding it you just use when it's very soft  you can use a mortar or s- of erm  erm  there's there's this type of spoon that you use in mashing usually that's the one I use at home I don't have put it  on erm  inside the mortar and pound like  pounded yam or like for whatever  I just use the spoon to just mash it  and mash it once it is cooked it is very soft  so you can even use a fork and you just mash  make it wet  and then is  yes yes so our potatoes are fried  it is time to just pack them out you just put it  okay because it will turn into a golden colour you can see it is no longer  the way I put it it is now golden colour it's looking  aha  and then the onions are already getting brown so I just have to pack it out  yes  so I think that's it and if I want to fry my eggs now I will just erm  remove this groundnut oil because it's much so I'll have to  use a smaller  frying pan yes  and I'll just put a little  of my oil I'll break two eggs  beat the eggs and add a little of salt and I will just fry it  now but sometimes I can just slice few onions and  few  tomatoes and then  just maybe  a pepper and then add it and then fry it   yeah you can eat it with your fish you can fry your fish  and just eat it and sometimes you have ketchup it is being eaten with ketchup you just eat it with ketchup you are in a hurry you don't want to do all those fry as it is now I would just use ketchup to eat it and then I go  but most of the time you know  erm  the northern person doesn't know ketchup so much so what we do is then we just  make our t- erm sauce from tomatoes onions and pepper  and so you just eat it with it yes    so the boiled one you can eat it with your stew like I said you can eat it with any other thing that you want you can if you want to eat with your fish  and you don't want to erm you want to have it like a sauce you will also make a s-  erm the sauce and then you add your fish like stew and you eat it yes so variety of ways of doing it  yes  no we eat more of  meat because we don't have in Jos you don't have erm  you don't have river  yes  but in my own state Adamawa state where I come from we eat a lot of fish because we have  river Niger river Benue passes through  erm  Adamawa so we eat a lot of fish in Adamawa but when I'm in Jos I eat a lot of  erm  meat yes yes  yes  yes but we have a lot of vegetables  in Jos different types of vegetables we have  cabbage erm carrots  green pepper in fact all the vegetables that you see  in erm yes  comes from Jos  yes  yes  they come from Jos they have a lot of it every type most of the foreigners that come they live in Jos because  the weather is beautiful and then they can have access to all these their type of food  you know potatoes and all their type of  vegetables yes yes  yes is very different you know like erm erm the  way we make our ewedu is different from the way you people make it yes  we you call it ewedu here  while we call it erm ayoyo yes  ayoyo or  erm  I've forgotten the other name  but it's either ayoyo  or but is the same ewedu but instead of cooking it just the way you people cook it the way you Yoruba people cook it here  you know they will just use  a broom a special broom to make it  we cut our own we chop it  erm we chop it after chopping it  we cook with our meat and every other thing then you just add the chopped and you will erm so it doesn't  erm it doesn't become like  is just that  yes exactly  not as sticky as the way it is in Ibadan yeah it draws but not as  and if you want it to be draw very well we put potash something we call kanwan  mhm you just put kanwan inside and then  it draws erm  or there's what they call toka if you don't have kanwan is something is  more is stronger than t- erm potash tanwan so if you add it small it will just  make it to draw very well  we have a lot of okra in the north we have we dry it in fact you people don't even know the dried one like in Adamawa because it is a very sunny state  you know we have the sun in fact their slogan is sunshine state  so because the sun really comes out a lot there so you dry most of the erm vegetables  and so like the okra you dry it and then you  pound it  when it's dried  then you make soup it becomes like ogbono  the Ibo ogbono so ours is the dry okra okay yes  it's not our traditional food  but we don't know egusi erm so if we learned it like me because I'm here I learned how to do it and then I do but  our own traditional people don't have egusi so they don't know we use groundnut   yes groundnut paste the groundnut if you you know you have your groundnut you s- they will after pealing it you now put your pot on just fry it a bit so that the back  that back would you can or can come out easily  so when you remove the back  you will just grind the  groundnut so it becomes a paste  and once is in a paste is soft like your egusi so it thickens your soup when you are using aleho that's spinach  if you use a spinach you put the groundnut so it thickens it and gives it like  egusi soup yes  so our people usually use groundnut not egusi for those of us that have  stayed somewhere we use egusi  because we have learned how to use egusi yes we have pumpkin leaves in fact plenty  we use the pumpkin not just the leaves  we use the pumpkin itself we boil it  and the people eat it like that  and then they make soup with it  and make it  erm as a thickener not just the leaves  and then the leaves also we use it  to  cook the groundnut soup as well  so it comes with groundnut okay okay okay  so how how many kinds of potato do we have erm  over here  okay  okay  okay okay  mhm okay  and this is the common one here  or yeah  okay aha  okay  is common  okay mhm okay  yeah  and why do you need onions for the potato okay  okay  yeah  mhm okay  okay  okay  okay  okay  mhm  oh aha  okay  aha  okay  so and i-  is it the typical breakfast in Adamawa or  in Jos  ah in Plateau states okay  okay  mhm  okay  okay

 A and not B as a location how many people who will patronise that business in A as opposed to B what is the taste likely to be of the people in A as opposed to people in B it's important if you decide that you are going to set up a children erm clothing shop in a community where the youngest is eighteen year old now we have had the result of your business before you started because then there will be no children that will buy whatever you put in your shop so you need to know and I do hope that what we will hear today will underline the preparation the very rigorous preparation that had gone into preparing for the census the way the census exercise itself had gone and I had to take the not so easy erm decision when after the first three or four days of the census there were cries from this governors almost all the governor at why there will be no extension we can regard at- the census exercise as failed we tried to get money from erm development partners none we did not plan for that and we had no choice but to let the governors know that we will take at least borrow money from the so-called excess crude to put into the two extra days that we had to decree for the census exe- erm census exercise extension and I believe that those two extra days were useful indeed for us to be able to have something that we can regard erm erm everybody regarded at we nearly had up to hundred per cent almost almost up to hundred per cent coverage erm which is what of course should be the erm ideal today you will also have opportunity to ask questions all those naughty questions rumour that have been carried about you can then get those rumours cleared myth if there had been myth we can get those myth exploded  or shattered now what are the realities what is the truth about this exercise and this is what we are here for and I do hope that we will all be informed and be instructed at the end of this exercise discuss in the way you're talking about it is better for us to get the result together and then we can  we can discuss her behind closed doors when she's not there that is not suggestive that you're taking treatment over her head because right now I have a saying the patient must be part of the decision I will ask the patient this is what we intend to do wouldn't be not erm not impressed alone even take ? over here in my own unit which is the time ? I say to patient I customise my survey I sit the patient down what is the point when you ? with a patient who may not be able to afford ? ? to find out from within and say that is why you eat this is what I think you deserve do you feel the post op management would be able to cope so you are enquiring on a complaint that I that I did not look into the review and the culture of the patient before you transpose anything because you do you're not going to get the same result finally you just like when one communicate in the US and you are talking about consent I say what do you mean by what consent age is culturally based well that was a time last week when I played around with erm professor Williams we particularly ? when you send the patient from Glasgow from Edinburgh from anywhere Professor Williamson will be telling that acquired you see this operation last about six hours even with my experience ? yes that's what he sent ? you know you are good great well I said what you may ? now I tell one day Professor said to Nigerians and at that time I believe in that listen whatever here the government tell ? I say no like I said I have to find a way of telling that patient that I do it because ? I'll use another example there are many complications finished for you to find a way of and reduce all complications alright ? you may lose your voice if it happen to you and I say I have been doing this for so many and we have been lucky with the support of God that we pray to the average patient and be religious ? he believes it or not many of them I wouldn't say hundred per cent have not suffered anything so this day is culturally based and we must look into it before you honestly judge ? I wasn't sure and I said what ? have I made to even venture putting together a workshop probably we would have you know talked and gone to sleep yeah but you know from the discussion you know so far you we are on the right track and I know that next time around which we'll get around have until that will be accepted that's not to say that the conference is not good enough I think what matters is the quality of discussion and erm we are also paving the way for big big networking even among the erm with doctors erm from both side of the Atlantic who lived here erm thank you Marina for the last erm  statement you made saying you've come over here to help them too    and I'm so glad you said so yeah that's delightable thing to hear we need support you know for this change of the cultural perception so that our women will begin to see this disease as something that is curable that is no longer a you know a death sentence erm from my experience and I I know it's now an old story but some of you here you know you don't have you know ? so it's it's good for me to say it all over again erm honestly erm a breast cancer survivor erm I must hold that spread and just erm six erm little bit six months older than pregnant erm I ? that left here that is my surgeon and we really erm doing and still doing a lot of stuff together erm I'll get to that ? the point is that erm when I felt this lump it wasn't as if I knew I knew what breast cancer examination the routine of do this do that ? well I can tell you that while I was at the university in the seventies we ? this mattered ? and we just hear it in person in passing of a breast self-examination for breast cancer I never you know knew how to really do it erm somehow when I had my bath I maybe I I was just I don't know I just do like this  it's part of me and ? I felt that bump that early morning and of course my mind raced to breast cancer and I said cannot be normally I was gonna be ? for this I was ? two years but but I became restless because something kept ringing in my ears it's breast cancer I said it cannot be my mind went to my children who will take care of my children look at all the plans I made out for myself I you know I'm I'm a very how will I put it I'm I'm a very restless I'm a very restless individual if I don't have my hand in this I will look for other you know something like that so you can't ? at this age I think I was forty three or so when I was diagnosed I said it's not possible and went through this trouble all alone but I was just lucky I was on leave that time and I kept busy watching TV and all the rest at the time I I had a erm DS- no not DSTV then it was midnight it was satellite erm erm cable network so I just tuned in that morning and I saw on Sky  TV this programme can save your life that was what the presenter said immediately I op- you know and tuned in to the TV Rolando Show I don't know if anyone of you knows Rolando she is a US-side talk show Rolando I always quote her each time I'm making this kind of testimony she's in the maybe Oprah is the bigger mass programme they are in the same you know erm profession she's a talk show erm host hostess or something like that so you know and I said what could this be and it was about breast cancer survivors and there was that woman they just showed up they traced her right from the time she they her lump was erm discovered and they showed us the mammography that was in fact that was the first time I saw this ? and so on she had surgery she was sh- she was shown when she lost all the hair and so on and she's the mother of the Baldwin brothers those very three handsome men those Doctor ? you know these actors I'm talking about the Baldwin brothers yes their mother and this only that way and just shared the experience of you know being part of a group of mothers that had breast cancer and all that and the woman was so you know after all that losing hair and everything they turn around and she was you know courageous enough to be on the television network and she had the guts to speak about it and her doctor sat beside her also they were able to share their experience with the audience and I said even though these are white you know you're going to survive this thing even though I had not been told really that it was breast can- all I knew that it was a lump that ? made me get up to go and see the doctor and I never went to our family doctor this custom of not making I don't know when we were talking about the attitude of patients I don't know if this is cultural ? we don't seem to disclose this thing to someone very close to us I don't know I didn't go to our family doctor I went to an alumnus who is not even a surgeon nor have something to do with breast cancer but she is erm I think erm ophthalmologist because she's an alumnus of my university I felt more comfortable to go to her than to my family doctor I don't know why I did that anyway then she confirmed there was a lump you know she by her training she's not expected to go far she's an ophthalmologist so you don't expect much yeah she really confirmed there was a lump and then she called on me she said you have to go to SOP surgery and she didn't know anyone to really address this referral to it was just an open thing just go there that was how she felt and I walked to the SOP and the man referred me to just sit there okay then ? erm erm consultant surgeon on Tuesday  you go see h- see him it happened to be Mister Akute and I tell you that this is probably I go to this door and I saw Mister Akute and I said Mister Akute could this be this can't be a doctor I wasn't sure honestly I wasn't sure I stood there for a while I said Mister okay well you know I have to ask so I go in there and sat down and before he started I needed to be sure excuse me sir I need to know are you really a doctor ? he laughed he was amused and he now educated me you can imagine then after how many years after my university education I never knew that those who had their erm specialist training in in Edinburgh instead of from Doctor they become Mister I didn't know so that was how I met Mister Akute and he really took care of me and of course I was very curious I'm not I'm not the kind of patient you say do this and I'd ask you why you want me to do this so I think he also found me interesting and we worked together in fact I I had a say in my in my treatment course of treatment and I want to tell you here that I didn't take chemo I did not take chemotherapy because I looked at the the pathologist's report you know when the result come I want to see I read it of course I I I went haywire about reading everything about breast cancer on internet name it I when I talk people do ask are you a doctor I'm not but I had read so widely and I learnt that my lymph nodes were not affected mine was stage one and it was just localised and I said this is not affected then I don't need chemo and I react everyday everyday drug if I should take this chemo I would even die the next week I'd better enjoy this five years ? that's about all and and and take care of my children and here I'm ten years on  you go on right ? it's more than that so so with the issue of patients having a say I know that it would be difficult for mostly educated women then at the same time that's why our groups are being formed we want to educate our women we want them to have a say it's not only when you go to university that you can have a say in your course of treatment we can even our rural women let them know let them know about this disease let them ask question and I I am using this opportunity to to plead with our doctors erm Doctor Adusa you're here some of your decision making obviously sir make no one to overlook us and say what are these people saying and it will make your work a lot easier for example the issue of this mammogram if you get this information out more women will come for check-up you won't be getting stage three four any more because they now aware this one breast cancer ? in the Western world today everywhere ? people do give cards to go a mammography centre to get their breast checked it's it's fun it's not far it's not anything to be afraid of  or you want to shy away and that's a good thing we all want to do it's the best thing in this country  so I if you leave me you just we'll sit here  then I will just call ? I one man Solomon said God you sought for a man let me be an intercessor and God came in the night as a son you have done something that is uncommon tell me what you want me to do blood cries to heaven and God changed his mind God didn't only give him rest God gave him the things he didn't ask for when man failed God knew that there is a law that must be activated sacrifice echoes in heaven and it is established on the earth it's an ordinance that never fails in the hand of a erm a covenant man they knew that the only one to do to s- arrest the devil is to shed blood from by the law of predestination he slayed Jesus even when Je- even before he was slayed listen to me you cannot be important on the earth until you are given to shedding of blood until you are given to sacrificial lifestyle men can occupy gates by sacrifice men can take over the heavens and the earth of their generation by sacrificing something amazing happens in the Book of Second Kings chapter three the Moabites were attacking three kings Jehoshaphat Ahab and one other Edom erm the king of Edom they went to him sir what do we do Elisha consulted God and God said tell them to go they will eradicate the Moabite and they began to fight and they began to fight the Bible said they were molesting and killing the Moabites but the king stood upon an altar and peeped into the archive and saw John three sixteen where it was written for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son he peeped into that Revelation of course Revelation will always separate men what I know and you don't know is what gives me advantage over you he said boy he called the first son he looked at the boy and lifted up his sword and cut off his neck and carried the corpse and went to the mount god of Molech he said Molech I come to you I sacrifice God looked from heaven and said what is happening the Bible said and God turned back on the people of Israel and they began to lose the battle I don't know why you are losing battle a man went on a higher revelation and the hand of God was pushed back by their s- the superiority of the incantations and sorceries they are delaying the hand of God upon your life he say my people perish because they lack he said the sons of darkness prosper more than the sons of light why because they don't know how to apply Revelation heavens of men cannot be opened until there is sacrifice the earth of men will not yield increase until there is blood and if God must mature you there'll always come a time when God will tell you to give him things that are difficult you don't know the strength of the altar that is fighting you but when God said I need men to come to the altar with blood you begin to reason him out two forms of sacrifice and whenever I talk about sacrifice people think about money it's not only about money we have two major forms of sacrifice number one is bodily sacrifice bodily sacrifice or consecration bodily sacrifice say offer yourself as a living sacrifice the reason why you are still where you are is because the most basic sacrifice which is your soul and your body you've not done that number two sacrifice is financial or material sacrifice the Shunamite woman in the book of second Kings chapter four verse ten you say for Ho- Honey I perceive that this is an honourable man of God let us build something for him and they built a duplex for Elisha listen to me you can move the hand of God by the kind of things you do sacrifice you know you're not born again but you want to  give your life to Christ say God here am I change me mould me he's waiting tomorrow it might be too late maximise the moment now talk to God about yourself Lord I'm so sorry I have erred I've missed you Lord wash me purify me sanctify me Lord cleanse me Lord change my life I need your help Lord in Jesus merry name we have prayed your Excellences distinguished ladies and gentlemen having concluded the first segment we shall now move to the

because branch near branch when the total chairman of the party was speaking he tried to mention the things we have done Mister Chairman those things that Rivers state has done for the past seven years nine months was because we had the resources to do them the credit for the availability of resources to states of the federation under the PDP administration of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo was because of the implementation of the thirteen per cent derivation fund which Obasanjo approved and implemented and the states are benefiting from and so we want to use this opportunity to thank our president for being a man of his word for respecting the constitution for paying attention to the Niger Delta even though e never beleful us o abi no be so but when when our presidential candidate

Rivers state good evening I would first of all like to extend my  gratitude to God almighty for giving me Doctor Goodluck Jonathan and the presidential campaign team the honour and privilege to be home in Port Harcourt in Rivers state the home of PDP the heart beat of PDP the li- centre of the life ? and the centre of the south-south and the Niger Delta the heart that beat to send forth the supporting life blood of all Nigeria after giving thanks to God I'd like to especially thank my friend brother and colleague Sir Doctor Peter Odili a friend indeed our bond and friendship goes beyond party politics it is a bond of friendship that transcends anything known either party politics or governors or while we meet in our meeting it is a chemistry that clicks I want to thank you for your brotherhood for your friendship for your support for your encouragement you and your people the people of Rivers state have given me a lot of support and inspiration in whatever I do whenever I think of you or Rivers state I feel a sense of satisfaction and I know at any given time whatever situation I am in I have you as a pillar of support and we have Rivers state and your people as our pillar of support it is very difficult in such a situation to find the appropriate words to express one's feelings may God in his infinite mercy continue to bless you and all our leaders and all the good people of Rivers state erm I'm sure all PDP members in Rivers state and indeed throughout Nigeria are aware and conscious of the great effort our party is making to transform Nigeria our party under the leadership of our leader Chief Olusegun Obasanjo has charted out a road map for the transformation of Nigeria from an underdeveloped nation to a modern industrialised nation and indeed we have set ourselves the target to be among that one tenth most developed economies of the world by the year two thousand and twenty I have no doubt in my mind this is a mission that every Nigerian should identify with this is a mission that every Nigerian must associate with because if we are able to do that then we'll solve the major part of our problems we'll bring our productive sectors into active production to generate and create wealth the agricultural sector the solid mineral sector the oil and gas sector which today is fairly limited to being only an extractive industry so that it comes alive within the Niger Delta region as a productive sector and the cyber sector will get a boost when we do this hundreds of thousands and indeed millions of jobs will be created and every Nigerian of working age will be gainfully employed every Nigerian will have the opportunity to make use of their God-given potential to work when we go to work we create wealth when we create wealth we give our nation the opportunity to develop therefore the measures there're four measures put in place by our leader and president Chief Olusegun Obasanjo as the greatest legacies that if elected as president we are going to build on and strengthen we have already outlined our programme in the seven point agenda saying that we are going to concentrate to ensure that the government continues the good work Chief Olusegun Obasanjo has begun in the critical sectors of our economy to provide the necessary basic critical infrastructure that will ensure our transformation from an underdeveloped nation to an modern industrialised nation now PDP has this programme PDP has all these things in its manifesto between two thousand and seven and two thousand and eleven the PDP manifesto directs the PDP federal government to ensure the creation of job opportunities by fifty per cent and the reduction the reduction of poverty by thirty per cent now these ideas these objectives we need to work hard as a party as a government and as Nigerians to be able to achieve the desired results what we are calling on all Nigerians is to join hands with PDP come into our umbrella our mission is good for this country our objectives are pure and directed at service to the people of this country we in the PDP our leaders our national leader Chief Olusegun Obasanjo our party leaders under Senator Doctor Amadu Ali and all of us who are in position of trust and who will be in position of trust we are committed to these ideas we are honest we are sincere we are responsible we have a burning passion to see Nigeria makes this transformation and we love this country we love its people we are going to dedicate our entire life to the service of this country in fact like I have always said the journey has begun Chief Olusegun Obasanjo has charted the way we are going to continue where he stopped and for Nigeria with this road map by PDP the era of the ruling elite in this country is over and the era of the servant leaders have begun we are going to serve this country you have heard briefly our aims and objectives we are going to ensure the transformation of our agriculture to make our people self-sufficient we are going to ensure the nation goes to work to create wealth we are going to ensure that the Niger Delta region which is strategic to the entire Nigerian nation we make moves to ensure its holistic overall development of the region in a plan agreed upon by all stakeholders the federal government all the state governments within the region the oil companies the community leaders our plan that will within a short period of time effect the complete and total transformation of the region this will require massive injection of funds and the federal government under our presidency is by the grace of God going to do that now who in this country let me ask who would not like to see Nigeria become among the twenty most developed nations of the world by the year two thousand and twenty in in thirteen years time who would not like that who would not work to ensure the attainment of this objective I believe and I have no doubt in my mind Nigerians are good people they are honest they are hardworking given the opportunity to make our country great we would work to do so we have a choice to make we must choose the path that have been charted out for our country by PDP it is the path of progress it is the path of human happiness it is the path of prosperity it is the path of peace it is the path of plenty it is the path of health we are going to have a healthy nation the way has been shown by PDP we need to work hard we need to persevere we need to have patience we need to continue to plan and execute our plans sincerely honestly and in the best interest of our great nation we must make sure that we change certain attitudes dishonesty corruption erm lack of trust laziness these are attitudes unknown to us in Nigeria Nigerians are hardworking people we must continue to cherish basic honesty we must continue to cherish hard work we must continue to cherish upholding trust we must continue to cherish sincerity these are the attitudes that are required to follow the path PDP has charted for this nation that will lead this country to greatness I'm asking and appealing to all Nigerians to choose the way of PDP when you vote for PDP in the April election you are voting for the transformation of Nigeria you are voting for the defeat of poverty you are voting for the defeat of unemployment you are voting for peace you are voting for progress and you are voting for the dignity of all Nigerians and you are voting to continue to chart the way PDP has worked out such that Nigeria will be great and become the pride not only of all

they're the economic provider for their family it shouldn't be they turn them into house helps it shouldn't be they maltreat many of them it shouldn't be so the child's rights law I want to appeal to all states that have not done it that they should sign this law so that our children will be off the streets the children can access universal basic education because it is compulsory it is not whether my child wants to go to school or not it is compulsory for every child of this nation to access nine years basic education it is free educating your child is a strength of parents your parents because they have erm they can afford it  that's why you are at private schools but those one cannot go to private schools it is important that their parents must allow them to go to school so you as children as well you also have to voice it out that parents allow your children to go to school don't turn them into the providers for your needs don't turn them into house girls because when they're on the streets they're open to a lot of negative things to a lot of abuses many of our girls are raped on the streets through this kind of street hawking or whatever so we're appealing that because these children they have their rights all states must sign the child's rights law so that we have better and informed future leaders the theme for this year is love and affection it's a beautiful theme it's what we really need most of the children out there especially of the from rich background this is what they lack the parents are not there to give them that love and affection you know if you're loved you'll be happy you'll be able to do a lot of things well if mummy shows you affe-  you know by the time mummy draws you near and just plants a kiss to you you are so happy you you you just grow and like I mentioned those special children it is love that they need so that's love our parents they show e- they they should always show love to their children because its when they show love and affection that this children will communicate with them they'd be able to share the experiences out there you know you have friends in school maybe your friend's going through something that is difficult and he tells you or maybe another friend wants to influence you negatively when you get home you will tell mummy because your mummy loves you shows affection you easily approach mummy or daddy but if that love is not there or affection that child will draw back if love is in a family and affection children will open up they'll be friends to their parents as well so I'm enjoining all parents that you should show love and affection to their children because that makes such children to be open to you to communicate with you share their problems at all time and it makes the family to be united and progressive and I pray you will grow up to be the kind of future leaders we expect in this country that will lead us right that believe in the values of this country and be very proud of this country and I pray the resources of your parents that they invest in you will bear fruits and you should be good children and hard-working because your parents are investing a lot in you you should be hard-working less of movie watching less of Facebook and so on and so forth so that daddy and mummy will continue to love you shower affection on you and continue to speak out for your less privileged children so God bless you as you celebrate spend this year's erm children's day which theme is love and affection I wish you God's love and God be with you all the chief host comrade

mourning on behalf of the good people of our great country Nigeria I stand by our First Lady her Excellency Hajiya Turai Yar'Adua the children her mother Hajiya Habiba Musa Yar'Adua and the entire Yar'Adua family and offer our heartfelt condolences on the demise of our amiable leader President Yar'Adua contribut- contribution to political development and good governance will never be forgotten

service he displayed uncommon commitment to the peace progress and unity of our dear country he has left for us a profound legacy that provides a firm foundation for Nigeria's future his exit has therefore created a huge vacuum in his personal contribution to the political growth and development of our nation I have lost not just a boss but a good friend and a brother having taken the oath of office in line with the Nigerian constitution under these very sad and unusual circumstances I urge all fellow citizens to remain steadfast and committed to the values and aspirations of our nation while this is a major burden on me and indeed the entire nation we must in the midst of such great adversity continue to garner our collective efforts towards upholding the values which our departed leader represented in this regard our total commitment to good governance electoral reform and the fight against corruption will be pursued with greater vigour as I've stated time without numbers we must enshrine the best standards in our democratic practice one of the true test would be to ensure that all votes count and are counted in the upcoming general elections similarly the efforts at ensuring the sustenance of peace and development in the Niger Delta as well as the security of life and property around the entire country will be a- of topmost priority the remaining period of this administration I want to reassure Nigerians that the pledges which we have made to improve the socio-economic situation which we face through improved access to electricity water education and facilities and other social amenities will continue to be given the needed emphasis the welfare of our  employed youths will also be accorded a new impetus my brothers and sisters I call on all

Adams Aliyu Oshiomole your Excellency the comrade governor of Ondo state Comrade Doctor Olusegun Mimiko your Excellency the governor of erm Bauchi state Governor Isa Yuguda the representative of other governors present here your Excellency Alhaji Balarabe Musa the former governor of Kaduna state your Excellency the former secretary to the government of the federation Chief Olu Falae the representative of the honourable minister of labour and productivity the representative of the minister of the speaker of the house of representatives Edo state House of Assembly and other protocols duly observed my welcome address is titled things are getting better in Edo state it is with great joy and melody in my heart that I welcome you to this ancient and venerable city of Benin the choice of Edo state as the venue for this conference I'm sure was informed not only by the wisdom of Solomon but by what we represent historically workers have always provided a vanguard for a positive change in our country and Edo state has been the source and symbol of such struggle as represented by Sir Michael Imoudu of blessed memory if you have heard that the labour of our heroes past the struggle during military dictatorships and the fight against political godfatherism electoral manipulator fraudsters are not in vain again Edo state provides the leading light as represented by a courageous labour leader a gallant social crusader great Nigerian our son the governor of Edo state Comrade Adams Aliyu Oshiomole with an unmistaken conviction in my heart I make bold to say that things are getting better in Edo state once upon a time the political penance and conventions in Edo state were so narrow parochial diabolical and dangerous but today every crooked way is being straightened once upon a time the pits and falls in the social life of the ordinary Edo people was so bleak and frightening again today light has come to shine on the people that once lived in darkness once upon a time the ups and downs in the life of our teeming youth occasioned by unemployment was such that the old saying that poverty anywhere constitutes a danger to prosperity everywhere was the rule rather than the exception but today every mountain and valley of unemployment is being levelled indeed things are getting better in Edo state right now political deviants and violators of our social ethics are no longer object of celebration in this state the reward system that was heavily skewed in favour of those who manipulate the socio-economic and political order is being reversed the patriarchs and scions of such inheritance are losing out fast in Edo state I can see a dying dynasty because the people are leading in Edo state however this calls for vigilance the involvement of labour leaders in party politics and democratic governance have rekindled rekindled the hopes of ordinary Nigerians yearning for a change a positive change a change that brings about sustainable development and a change for the common good of Nigerians at this conference we shall be reflecting on Nigeria at fifty what is the journey so far what are the issues at stake what are the challenges of nationhood any hope for Nigeria ladies and gentlemen many years ago as a young man I used to read those letters letter to my countrymen by a foremost Nigerian a great son of Edo state the prince is in the house we shall hear him today and many will heed him again naturally my expectation is that we are going to respond differently but no matter the side of the divide you are let us believe in the Nigerian project Nigeria can be great if we strive together and remain focussed we shall not only regain the ears eaten by the political locusts and social cankerworm but we would have provide an enduring platform for development at the business session of this conference we shall once again teach INEC what it means to conduct a free and fair election to us to us the implementation of Justice Uwais report is sacrosanct we urge politicians to learn to play by the rules of the game and allow for internal democracy in their political parties Edo state council congratulates our son the president general of TUC Comrade Peter Esele for providing an unparalleled leadership and direction for TUC if re-elected at this congress you certainly have one term to go but do not forget to act like the comrade governor of Edo state Comrade Adams Aliyu Oshiomole our brother and mentor who after serving his tenure as president of NLC came home you can do likewise step into his shoes when he moves off let me reiterate that you can step into his shoes when he moves off labour has come of age ladies and gentlemen once again I welcome you do have a happy stay and enjoy yourself in Edo state this is our eighth triennial delegate conference on behalf of the national executive council of the trade union congress of Nigeria I welcome you all to our eighth triennial national delegate conference in the ancient city of Benin we are highly honoured by the distinguished presence of your Excellences and officials of various government institutions firstly I sincerely welcome our esteemed friends allies progressive organisations civil society our erudite social partners I welcome all delegates and comrades from affiliates and acknowledge in a special way the company of our distinguished guests who have come from both within and outside the shores of our great nation in solidarity with us I feel boldly I feel both highly privileged extremely humbled to address you today I am indeed gratified of what we have been able to achieve collectively both for our members for the Nigerian masses for whom we have tried to provide with a voice on very critical national issues that touch every sphere of our society the theme of this conference is Nigeria at fifty issues and challenges the statutes of the delegate conference in trade union congress we have present here your Excellences delegates of all affiliates in all strata of the nation's workforce in public and private sector they are assembled here today in accordance with the provision of rule six and seven of the

and identify areas that need improvement this body will also set the agenda on the line of action for the congress in the next three years and beyond the tenure of all the elected officials of the national administrative council will also terminate election into the various offices will be held and the officers shall hold their positions till two thou- till twenty thirteen when another conference will hold I would also like to let you know that various officers will be elected tomorrow today is the public session and tomorrow will be the private session the state of the nation Chinue Achibe Nigerians foremost novelist once declared decades ago over the problem with Nigeria is simply and squarely the failure of leadership not everyone accepted his thesis quite a few intellectuals disagreed with him they thought his analysis too skimpy and conclusions rather simplistic however a critical look at the socio-political and economic realities of Nigeria makes it clear beyond doubt that the author of Things Fall Apart had his finger on the problem however one looks at the post-independence history of this nation a history defined by great potentials and miniscule achievement poverty amidst mind-boggling wealth revolving door of military adventurism and lack of vision in the part of civilian leadership the conclusion is inescapable Nigeria is where it is Nigeria is where she is because of who the leaders are ladies and gentlemen the above submi- that with the kind of leadership great stride can be made even in an environment that is largely hostile to excellence the examples may be found the examples may be few but they are very potent that great leadership can indeed make a difference distinguished ladies and gentlemen let me draw your attention to what is happening in the m- at the moment yesterday there are reports that another fourteen Nigerians were feared dead in Jos crisis our conference is taking place in amidst the background of recent state of senseless killing religious crisis that has engulfed Jos the Plateau state capital in the last couple of weeks just last week the nati- just last week to be precise on the seventh of March two thousand and ten over five hundred people were killed in Dogono hawa Rasat and Jos by suspect of marauding Fulani herdsmen since the first major ethnic crisis in two thousand and one over three thousand Nigerians have lost their lives with no possible end in sight we in the trade union congress condemn this in its entirety we are telling the government to rise up to the challenge as Martin Luther King said wherever injustice exist it becomes a threat to justice everywhere today it is Plateau tomorrow it could be any other state and the result of that will be anarchy in our country we're also aware of the growing state of insecurity one thing that is clear from what is happen in Jos is one fundamental issue that the various security agencies in Nigeria have failed Nigeria and its people every day and every time we are busy fighting crime nothing is done to prevent crime if those who are responsible for the perpetration and the killing in Jos are not brought to book then the people in Jos will look for justice themselves and in looking for justice you will have anarchy and there will be problem in the country that neither of us can comprehend we appeal to the acting president and the governor of Plateau and all those involved in what is happening in the Middle Belt that Nigeria is greater than any individual tribe race or religion Nigeria as a people and as a country we are bind together by the constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria and it is expected that every citizen have respect for the constitution distinguished ladies and gentlemen the Nigerian economy in the last three years has also given us serious serious cause for concern I would like to let you know that in the banking industry we have lost over ten thousand of our members as a result of the MDs and the chairman's playing kalo kalo with our future in other parts of the world in other parts of the world banks grow the economy in Nigeria our banks will declare mind-boggling profits and the economy is shrinking and we start wondering where are they making this profit from the bank instead of ensuring that this forms are deployed for long term strategic investment in infrastructure and power all through to capital market under underground dealing and the result is there for us all to see as our banks have gone distressed and now our members are losing their job to our member

seven to nineteen sixty there were so many of such conferences the first took place in Ibadan which was strongly criticised because of lack of consultation was decided that full consultation should be

candidacy for the twenty eleven presidential election the Europe correspondent of the news agency of Nigeria quotes Faboro as saying that the combination of Jonathan and Sambo is a true reflection of the ongoing campaign to rebrand Nigeria he said the group's endorsement and support for the presidential ticket was voluntarily and without any sponsorship by any political party based on the

to ensure the reelection of President Jonathan in twenty eleven Mister Job Peters the national secretary of the NGO said this in an interview he said in as much as the NGO wants the reelection of

with the situation and on the foreign scene a pro-unity demonstration in Khartoum ended in clashes between supporters and opponents as Sudan's president accused the former rebels in the south of going back on terms of a peace agreement that ended decade of conflict he also warns that Sudan may be heading for a new war if north and south differences on some issues are not settled before a crucial referendum in January amid rising tensions UN envoys urged Sudan to ensure the vote on southern independence is held on time the referendum is the result of a two thousand and five comprehensive peace agreement that ended the twenty one years' civil war between north and south that left up to two million people dead and that's the update on the programme today on STV the programme continues with interviews after this break Akintunde Sunday is one of the residents at Ifelodun street Ajegunle Ikorodu like most people in the area he struggles through the flood half naked to get dressed ashore floods in these communities is a yearly occurrence whenever water is released from Oyo dam in Abeokuta north local government area of Ogun state but people like Bernard a motorcycle operator has chosen to tolerate the annual inconveniences because it's cheap to live there though they were forewarned and advised to evacuate three weeks before the flood came but they claim the government didn't provide rescue plan or temporary shelter I'm paddling on canoe on a river-like water that has suddenly taken over what used to be a dry land for the residents of this area to access their homes for those that can't swim through they would have to board a canoe but at a price this canoe operator says the usual fare for ferrying passengers is thirty naira per head but charter canoe attracts up to a thousand naira per trip it's against the dignity and rights for humans to live this way observers hope both Lagos and Ogun state governments would find a lasting solution to this situation Vivienne

state Ene Offiong the monkey keeps eating the banana one bunch after the other wagging its tail in pleasure the monkey does not seem to know that too much of a sweet thing can kill my name is Sola Adewumi and you're welcome to my lounge from time immemorial many have wondered why men with so much to lose put everything on the line for the opposite sex why in the world do we men take the risk of losing families and careers in exchange for the forbidden sex Bill Clinton's eight years of brilliant leadership is often remembered for a sexual scandal with a White House intern because the most powerful man in the world could not control his sexual desires he ended up in contemporary American history not as the most popular president in modern times but as the impeached president as if to underscore the length that men go risking everything including their reputation Newt Gingrich the former Speaker of the U S House of Representatives was himself sleeping with another woman while still married this was at the same time that he was loudly condemning Bill Clinton for the same thing and the whole world is still trying to determine what former New York governor Eliot Spitzer was thinking when he was engaged in sexual escapades with prostitutes it is very easy for the so-called saved and sanctified to turn their spiritual noses up and dismiss these men as sinful unsaved and hell-bound creatures but how do we then explain King David a man that was anointed by God through the great prophet Samuel David was not only filled with the spirit of God God himself called David a man after his heart yet David with whom God had a covenant could not resist the temptation he risked everything that God had blessed him with committing adultery with Bathsheba even though he was told that she was Uriah's wife David did not just take the man's wife he took his life so he could keep the woman and we all know the story of Samson a strong he-man with great she-weakness he was a man who before he was born God had planned his purpose in life according to the angel that appeared to his mother Samson was created to begin the deliverance of Israel from the Philistines unfortunately this brave and strong man who could have the most beautiful woman in Israel as his wife had a roving eyes at first it was a Philistine woman and then a prostitute and ultimately Delilah and we all know what Delilah did to Samson perhaps you're one of those who think that Samson was not as smart as he was strong what about Solomon the wisest man that ever lived according to historical accounts King Solomon loved many foreign women who were from nations that God had commanded Israelites not to intermarry he had seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines who turned his heart away from God the source of his uncountable blessings from generation to generation men of great purpose have risked and in many instances lost everything in the turbulent and often dangerous ocean of passion psychoanalysts since the days of Sigmund Freud have continued to dig into the erotic minds of men to determine why it seems to be ruled by sex and ever so often risky sex Marvin Zuckerman a pioneering psychologist thinks many of these big men fit a personality type known as sensation seeker the sensation seekers are often high energy high functioning people who never seem to get enough excitement they do not just lust after things they take them often disregarding the risk involved for these type of people the risk is part of the reward it's also the alpha male whose level of testosterone is high high levels of testosterone creates a high sex drive a love of risk aggressiveness and competitiveness this type of people have a strong need to win and the more they succeed the higher their testosterone but forget all these psycho-jagbajantis what about plain conventional wisdom which suggests that people will always do stuff that they can get away with perhaps this is best expressed in Bill Clinton's words he said I did something for the worst possible reason just because I could because of their status and degree of influence the sexual misadventures of prominent men in society often get public attention but if the truth be told most men powerful and not so powerful influential and ordinary alike are equally afflicted the only difference is what we risk losing some risk their health and subsequently their lives for a one-night stand of unprotected sex some of us risk losing our homes wives and children when caught and we end up paying mortgages on houses that we don't even live in for some who are not married and therefore do not believe that they're accountable to one woman what they are actually throwing away is their hard earned money the last time I checked dating remains an expensive game just imagine how much you can save if you don't have to treat all those women let's be real I know that it is very difficult as a man to stay faithful especially with all the temptation out there and the women seem to be on a mission to track us like mice we all know that men are stimulated by what we see and boy are there sights to behold but guess what as real men we should have control over our desires after all we tell our kids that they cannot have all the candies they want simply because the candies are there for them to see it's all about self-control when you have difficulty controlling yourself just remind yourself of all the great men who lost so much because they could not keep their zippers locked and if you think that your case will be different because you are invincible remember the Lord is watching and we know that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom get your own brown sugar and if your preference is white sugar it's all good just get yours and keep your eyes and hands off the others my name is Sola Adewumi thanks for hanging out in my lounge welcome to AM Express sports this wonderful day Nigeria is

smile good evening I'm indeed happy to be here with you today not in my own capacity but to stand in for Mister President who travelled out yesterday on some national assignment he has asked me to convey his appreciation and greetings to all of you let me present his words Mister President of Senate most distinguished senators on behalf of the federal government of our beloved country Nigeria let me share in the enthusiasm of the moment as the senators undertake this very important task for empowering themselves towards better legislative performance and good governance retreats as we have come to understand offer participants an opportunity for reflection reappraisal and repositioning the goal of this government is to deliver on our promise of a better and greater Nigeria where economic and developmental fortunes promote the welfare of all citizens not too long ago the executive branch held a three-day retreat where we had the opportunity to listen and engage experts from various callings our intention was to reinvigorate ourselves and subject our strategies to unbiased enquiries the occasion enabled us to interact on a wide range of issues from the rule of law through anti-corruption and the need for a greater harmony and equality only last week the governors' forum held a retreat two days retreat that dwelt on good governance the needs of our people and the way to achieve that it is remarkable to note that the team of the senate retreat is enhancing the capacity of legislators to promote good governance order and peace in Nigeria all this shows a good omen for this country that our arms of government are in concert working to achieve good governance peace security and development of this country on May twenty nine this year we took oath to defend the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria Mister President of Senate distinguished senators I stand before the sixth senate of our republic to affirm that the oath that we took compels us to do what is right before God and our fellow countrymen and women on assumption of office we affirmed to respect not just the letters but the spirit of our laws believing that faithful obedience and respect for the rule of law will bring about the much needed order which is the most important ingredient for rapid development and stability in our country one fundamental implication of the observance of the rule of law is the respect for separation of powers in any given democracy the need for the executive the legislature and the judiciary to cooperate respect and support each other has never been more compelling our countrymen and women are demanding jobs better health care services good education basic infrastructure security and peace we have no choice but to work tirelessly to provide this our ability to meet the demands and expectations of our people will be dependent on the level of cooperation between the various arms of government the relationship between the executive the judiciary and the legislature must be like the excellent relationship enjoyed by children of the loving parent who show us love and opportunity to all without favour Nigeria is our loving parent and we cannot afford to betray the blessings she has bestowed on us all her offsprings the separation of power doctrine prevents tyranny and all forms of arbitrariness in governance it was never conceptualised to separate the country or create problems that undermine our aspiration for justice equity and enduring development after all the country is one Soludo will tell you that the economy is one security is one and we use the same infrastructure any matter that prevents the effective function of one arm of government must be resolved very quickly but with an eye for due process respect for rule of law and justice we must practise this doctrine of power separation for the ultimate good of our people for we hold these offices at their behest distinguished senators your choice of Port Harcourt as venue for your retreat shows a senate that is alight of its responsibility understand that you'll be going to the Creeks to see things for yourselves our government on inauguration made the commitment to right the wrongs not only of the Niger Delta but the entire nation as well and we are calling on the Senate to partner with us so as to realise our vision in this regard there are so many things the legislature and the executive can do together to bring about the much needed change in the Niger Delta region ex- explaining what you see during this visit to members of your own constituency and taking appropriate steps to make effective legislation that help the communities meet their aspirations for survival and protection of their environment will be step in the right direction the Niger Delta crisis is without doubt a national emergency and resolving it therefore is a matter of national priority one of the most important challenges before us as members of the executive and the legislature is the assignment of reviewing the constitution in the last eight years several constitutional review initiatives have been left unfinished the executive the legislature and civil society have at one time or the other embarked on constitutional review that are yet to meet our collective aspiration an occasion such as this offers us an opportunity to remind ourselves of the need to make our constitution work for us all as one people under God the weak as well as the strong the haves and the have-nots the governed and the governors must all derive their powers and protection and responsibilities from the constitution of our country the sections the paragraphs and chapters must speak to our vision of a greater Nigeria where there are observable lacunae we owe it to ourselves and generations yet unborn to correct them with the appropriate amendments the present document shows some unwarranted prevarication and dalliance on the matter of local government creation boundary adjustment the electoral system citizenship among others where there is obfuscation this senate must try to give clarity to some sections and paragraphs in the constitution where an additional law will help our country move faster in our race to development we urge you never hesitate please legislate I see a country where all citizens enjoy fundamental rights from where hunger and want are banished I see a society where our love for one another becomes the bedrock of national aspiration I see a country where the citizens are totally patriotic even as we prepare to receive the good things that we have been promised by the almighty God Mister President the legislative arm of government has power to make our dream of a greater Nigeria come true  the vision of government in this regard has been captured in our seven-point agenda and it will be a great pleasure to work collectively with senators to have this realised within the shortest possible time my dear President of Senate your Excellences distinguished senators my brothers and sisters I thank you for your attention God bless Nigeria and Nigerians I wish you a most fruitful deliberation in your retreat thank you all and erm this week the world commences the sixty fourth anniversary of the tragedy of Hiroshima and Nagasaki indeed it was on August six that the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima three days later

which had refused to surrender three months after Germany and her allies had surrendered stopped fighting effect of the bomb was so catastrophic that even the pilot that dropped the bomb on Hiroshima on his safe return from the mission simply wrote in his log God save my soul the bomb also sparked off the nuclear arms race amongst the world super powers sixty four years after the memory of that black history haunts the conscience of the world this week also two world activists made history first is Doctor Nelson Mandela the former South African president it was this week August five to be precise that Doctor Nelson Mandela was finally arrested and charged with incitement and illegally leaving South Africa in nineteen sixty two a lawyer by profession Mandela made history defending

glorious speaker was targeted and stoned on August five nineteen sixty six while leading a protest march in the streets of Chicago Luther is remembered for his dogged non-violent revolution and his glorious speeches most memorable of which is the one he entitled I have a dream on a science note this week in nineteen fifty nine the first television photograph of the earth from space was taken by

medals in the nineteen eighty four summer Olympics in the USA then to the Nigerian events it was this week in nineteen sixty eight that France made a veiled support for the Biafran cause  when it rose

Belgium then in Nigeria when on May seven nineteen eighty eight President Ibrahim Babangida inaugurated the constituent assembly he charged the five hundred and sixty seven man assembly headed by Justice Anthony Aniagolu to spare themselves the time and energy debating certain areas of the constitution for those areas were no-go areas this stirred some cyclone of reactions from within and outside the assembly circles I remember that the constituent assembly spent the whole of May June July and the first two weeks of August nineteen eighty eight debating the no-go area advice of General Babangida eventually the assembly ended their debate and settled down for business by resolving into twenty two committees on August fifteen nineteen eighty eight this week indeed the status of the Sharia court of appeal which rocked and rumbled through the constituent assembly in nineteen seventy seven seventy eight nearly rubbished the constituent assembly members of the state judicature committee committee sixteen led by Alex Anielo that handled that issue will never forget their experiences it took the intervention of the Vice President Admiral Aikhomo to save the committee and just

take possession of parts of Nigeria by the colonial masters continued one significant history made this week in the areas of Igboland was a signing of commercial treaties with local chiefs it was this week on August twenty eight in eighteen eighty four that George Taubman Goldie signed one of such treaties with Asaba chiefs this was exactly a week after he had completed similar treaties with Onitsha chiefs on August twentieth it was also this week August twenty three nineteen sixteen that a pacification of Nenwenta community in Awgu by the colonial masters began the mission was led by Captain H Webber the assistant district officer of Okigwe who was resident at Amuda with nine police officers under Sergeant Samaji who was killed in the battle by Nenwenta warriors on the f- on that fateful day twenty f- third August nineteen sixteen it should be mentioned here that Nenwenta was one of the Igbo communities whose local warriors gave the white men a hell of time to conquer the National Council of Nigeria which later became National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons NCNC was formally founded this week on August twenty six nineteen forty four by Herbert Heelas Macaulay Macaulay was its pioneer president while Nnamdi Azikiwe was the secretary one of the gravest regional assembly crises in Nigerian history was the Eastern House of Assembly crisis of nineteen fifty six the Sir Stafford Foster-Sutton's commission of enquiry occasioned the crisis the commission which investigated a two million pound scandal in the African Continental Bank ACB involving Doctor Nnamdi Azikiwe who was leader of the House then began sitting this week August twenty seven nineteen fifty six the enquiry came as a result of a motion from E O Eyo the chief whip of NCNC the ruling party in the House who was also the deputy speaker calling for the enquiry to investigate Zik and his interest in the bank that was viewed as a sacrilege to the zikists in the House and outside it it was during this week August twenty eight nineteen sixty eight that the Addis Ababa peace talks on the Nigerian Civil War was formally adjourned to be resumed at the Algiers summit of the OAU that opened on September thirteen nineteen sixty eight in Algeria it was also this week on August twenty eight nineteen seventy five that a Statutory Corporation Service Commission and the Corporation's standing

New Nigerian Newspapers Tolu Olatimi editor Sunday Times and Sule Katagun were all released and political prisoners were also released they included ex governors Lateef Jakande of Lagos state Doctor Michael Ajasin of Oyo and Olusola Saraki of Kwara state in nineteen ninety three this week President Ibrahim Babangida stepped aside and Chief Ernest Shonekan became chairman of the interim national government which Babangida instituted while stepping aside August was named after Augustus Caesar the emperor who reigned in the days of Jesus Christ and as usual we feature hidden historic events in Nigeria for instance the colonial conquest of Nigeria and many African states began with missionary and commercial adventures by Europeans these harmless and mutual adventures began to take political dimensions at the dawn of the nineteenth century with the Berlin Conference of eighteen eighty five the political dimensions assumed a scramble where emerging European powers tore Africa to pieces in the name of taking possession of colonies to rule in Africa in Nigeria where the British held sway against the French the colonial conquest began with the raiding of Lagos and sacking of King Kosoko of Lagos in eighteen sixty one it may interest you to know that it was on August six eighteen sixty one that King Dosunmu of Lagos and his cabinet chiefs signed the treaty of cession that made Lagos a possession of the British Empire and that marked the beginning of the British colonial overlordship in Nigeria at about the same time in eighteen sixty four Reverend Ajayi Crowther who had on June twenty nine eighteen sixty four been promoted to a bishop and put in charge of the bishopric of West Equatorial Africa in the Canterbury taught the Bonny kingdom where he later founded a chapel school in August eighteen sixty six the man who is on records past the man who won the districts of Niger for the British Empire is Lord Taubman Goldie and now he made a total of thirty seven treaties with chiefs and their communities within his trading influence the implication of these being that Taubman Goldie had by peaceful treaties acquired the Niger territories including Igboland for the British in eighteen eighty five as a matter of fact it was this month that Lord Goldie had completed two of this treaties in Igboland he signed with Onitsha chiefs on August twenty eighteen eighty four and with Asaba chiefs on August twenty eight eighteen eighty four this means Onitsha and Asaba became British colonies on these dates however many of this treaties could not hold as later events of resistance and war by most Igbo communities showed the British between nineteen oh oh and nineteen nineteen had to contend with pacification pathos across Igboland and beyond to keep and control the areas as British colonies the starting point of the pacification pathos in Igboland begun with the Aro in nineteen oh one approval was given to Rap More by the secretary of state on July thirty one nineteen oh one but the actual beginning of the battle plans to fight Aro and destroy the Ibinu Ukpabi which the white men named Aro Long Juju began with a memo that gave details on August twenty nineteen oh one Aro was eventually conquered December twenty eight nineteen oh one from then on the battle ran into Afikpo the next year with Afikpo capitulating December twenty eight nineteen oh two Abakaliki country was visited next while the Bende areas had their visitations also the coming of the World War one  nineteen fourteen to nineteen eighteen complicated matters for the British warriors in Igboland they had to contend with deadly rumours said to be spread by the Aros to incite the Igbo communities to resist the colonial lordship of the British the rumour was that the British had been defeated by the Germans in the neighbouring Cameroon  and were in hiding in Nigeria the Nenwe people in Awgu division believed this so much that they scorned the white men and dared them into a deadly battle that led to their brutal pacification on August twenty three nineteen sixteen the colonial brutality over the nations led to the resentment and the coming of nationalist movement by educated natives one of the foremost nationalists and indeed a man regarded as the primo father of Nigerian nationalism is Herbert Samuel Heelas Macaulay born eighteen sixty four Macaulay trained as an engineer he founded the first political party in Nigeria the party which was named Nigerian National Democratic Party NNDP was founded in nineteen twenty two but by August twenty six nineteen forty four this party mutated into the National Council of Nigeria and Cameroons NCNC with Macaulay as its pioneer president and Nnamdi Azikiwe as its secretary Zik took over the national leadership of the party in nineteen forty six but Macaulay slumped and died at the campaign grounds in Kano talking about Zik it was in the month of August that he suffered one of the greatest image assaults of his political life in nineteen fifty six this was as a result of the two million pound ACB scandal that led to the setting up of a commission of enquiry headed by Sir Stafford Foster-Sutton to investigate Zig's involvement and interest in the bank the enquiry was occasioned by a motion from Honourable Eyo O Eyo the chief whip of the NCNC the ruling party in the Eastern House of Assembly who was also the deputy speaker calling for investigation of Zik this was viewed as a sacrilege as Zik conjured a larger than life image then the Zikists never forgave Honourable Eyo and his non-Igbo-speaking followers leading to the political strains that often play up between south easterners and their Cross Riverian and Akwa-Ibom brothers three years before this event Zik and others had led the cream of the nation's political leaders to one of the landmark constitutional conferences in London the conference began July thirty and ended August twenty two nineteen fifty three the communique of the conference was made public the next day August twenty three nineteen fifty three the decisions of the conference were as far reaching as they were historic landmarks in the life of the nation some of the historic decisions included the federal system of government in which residual powers will be vested in regional governments that legislative powers should be shared between the centre and federating units the regional lieutenant governors be called governors while the governor of Nigeria be designated governor general that subject to ratification by a conference to be held in Lagos in nineteen fifty four a separate regional administration to be established in the Cameroons if the inhabitants express such a desire in a referendum but Lagos being detached from the western region  and made a neutral capital territory but Her Majesty's government would in nineteen fifty six grant independence to those regions which desire it then in recent history it was this month on August twenty eight nineteen ninety that Commodore Ebitu Ukiwe the first chief of general staff in General Ibrahim Babangida's government was replaced by Vice Admiral Augustus Aikhomo who later became the vice military president of Nigeria under General Babangida this was five years after the coming to power of General Ibrahim Babangida in a Palace Coup that ousted the duo of major generals Muhammadu Buhari and Tunde Idiagbon on August twenty seven nineteen eighty five it was this month on August four two thousand and four that Okija shrine saga rocked the nation generally this month many African nations celebrated their independence anniversary some of this nations included Benin Republic August one nineteen sixty Niger Republic August three nineteen sixty Côte d'Ivoire  August eight nineteen sixty and others world wide many historic events also happened in August August two nineteen ninety Iraq invaded and annexed Kuwait leading to the forty two day world war it was also in August nineteen forty five that Nagasaki and Hiroshima were levelled with atom bomb by Americans  dear listener I greet you in the most gracious name of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ I wish to discuss the topic making right choices making right choices the question that you might ask is how do we know choices that are right and those that are wrong the Book of Proverbs chapter twenty one verses two to three states I quote every way of a man is right in his own eyes but the Lord ponders the heart unquote thus even when a man treads evil paths it appears right to him man therefore needs direction and erm to be able to fulfil his destiny on earth again the Book of Proverbs chapter fourteen verse twelve further clarifies I quote there is a way which seems right to a man but the end thereof are the ways of death unquote therefore we need to identify those ways which appear right and rosy but when we follow them we end up in death such ways should be avoided the question is how can we know the right way which endo- ends up in life and the wrong way that ends up in death so that we can choose to move on the right way the answer is that we need to give our lives to Jesus Christ be controlled and directed by Holy Ghost power and as we commune with God He will direct our ways through that still small voice of the Holy Spirit you will then choose the way that will eventually lead you to heaven and not to hellfire however the way you may be directed may not be the easy way for the moment but with time its superiority will be evident by the direction of the Holy Spirit you will follow the right track which at the onset may appear more difficult may we check the scriptures for clarification the Book of Hebrews chapter eleven verses twenty four to twenty seven states I quote by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God l- than to enjoy pleasures of sin for a season hence Moses chose the right way which entailed suffering at the beginning his decisions and actions were directed by the Holy Ghost and he never yielded to the pleasures of life and deceitfulness of riches he never allowed them to determine the way he chose to move as he obeyed God in his actions God used him later to lead the children of Israel out of Egypt towards the promised land that's wonderful what about you I want you to reflect on your choices in life what actually motivates your action are your actions ordered by a quest for money popularity good food good education or receiving favours from man or are your actions ordered by the Holy Spirit power to do things that you know are right and then living righteously unfortunately when we consider what is happening in the world today we see the foolish choices made by people especially the youths beloved I don't know what you are going through right now are you in school and do not have adequate maintenance or your parents don't even have resources to send you to school or have you finished your education having obtained a good result and yet have no employment your pr- parents may have suffered a lot to pay your school fees but for five years or more you have remained unemployed your plans to marry and settle down in life may have shattered and yet you know that your suffering was the result of mismanagement of our resources by our leaders in this country flowing with milk and honey may I ask you my sweetheart whatever suffering you are undergoing now is it worth choosing to die prematurely and ending up in hellfire for everlasting life what is your own predicament are you a girl sent to school by your average parents who may have other children to train and so do not have adequate funds to eat all you desire and dress fashionably as your mates not minding the Christian upbringing you had received have you now chosen do go into prostitution which could lead you to premature death and hellfire for eternity because as a prostitute you could be an easy prey to kidnappers ritual murderers traffickers of human parts sexually transmitted diseases or getting pregnant now and again are you now into regular abortion and continue to destroy your own children are your own children suffering your vengeance are they the cause of your problems or do you leave school any time you are pregnant to a special home where you stay to deliver your babies and sell them for adoption and sometimes to ritual murderers have you deadened your conscience what a terrible choice choice of hellfire for eternity what really is your own situation are you a male or female have you been trapped in the occult is life in the occult better than what you have what a mistake you have made as a member of the occult have you now been enlisted in the gang of armed robbers drug traffickers gang of thieves four one nine cheats ritual murderers and so on and so forth what a terrible choice you have made do you know that this planet earth is not our home but we are strangers here and so our stay on earth is for a very short time while heaven or hellfire is for everlasting life let us refer to scriptures for assurance the Book of First Peter chapter one verses twenty four to twenty five states I quote for all flesh is grass and all the glory of man as the flower of grass the grass withers and the flower therefore falls away but the word of God endures forever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached to you unquote thus this portion of the Bible is emphasising on the shortness of human life and that we should not be deceived by any pomposity or magnificence in this world as they are ephemeral that is lasting for a very short time your choice of staying with Satan in the kingdom of darkness implies that you are controlled by the lust of your eye or flesh or by the pride of life I pray that you will gain reason today and make amends think about it is it not really better to suffer deprivation than to go into such a choice of death here on earth and eternity since hellfire is referred to as second death the Book of Revelations chapter twenty one verses seven to eight directs I quote he that overcomes shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone which is second death unquote dear listener do you ever realise that when you give your life to Jesus Christ and continue in life of righteousness your al-  problem will now be taken to Him please turn with me to the Book of Isaiah chapter forty three verses one b to two I quote fear not for I have redeemed you I have called you by name you are mine when you pass through the waters I'll be with you and through the rivers they shall not overflow you and when you walk through fire you shall not be burned neither shall the flame kindle upon you unquote remember that the name of Jesus Christ is a strong tower where the righteous run to for salvation and protection why don't you try Him today the kingdom of light is so superior to that of darkness that you cannot compare the two why don't you take your problems to Him He will surely take over your problems to solve them or direct you to a better path that will enable you fulfil your destiny may we refer to His assurance in the Bible first Peter chapter three verse twelve explains for the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous and his ears are open to their prayers but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil unquote every Christian should prayerfully map out the fasting and p- praying schedule for each month of the year apart from your fasting schedule you need to fast and pray and wait on the Lord when you have certain problems some of us only fast during the Lenten season it's simply inadequate when you have certain dreams where you are overcome by the power of darkness you have to go immediately into fasting and praying asking God to destroy the effect of such spiritual attacks after taking authority over them you can even ask a more spiritual person to pray with you since corporate prayers are more effective than individual prayers especially when you are not a matured Christian you must realise the importance of fasting in the life of a Christian apart from receiving answered prayers and being close to God when you fast you also build attributes of the fruit of the spirits such as self control and long suffering which includes patience endurance tolerance and perseverance these are effective in toughening your body removing and reducing your lust of the eye and flesh and enable you endure and persevere more in your life endeavours you are therefore not likely to fall prey to lack of self control in your actions as was the case of Esau in the Book of Genesis chapter twenty five verses twenty nine to thirty four Esau sold his birthright with an oath because of hunger to his younger twin brother Jacob who in return fed him with bread and pottage of lentils so he ate and drank and despised his birthright God was very annoyed with Esau for his behaviour of lack of long suffering and self control and in the Book of Malachi chapter one verses two b to three God lamented I quote was not Esau Jacob's brother says the Lord yet I loved Jacob and hated Esau beloved know it now that if you continue being attracted to the goodies of this planet earth and engulfed with get rich quick syndrome hellfire will be your eternal destination why don't you make a right choice now and be heaven bound and accept Christ into your life being translated from the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of light repent of your sins a broken and contrite heart is what Jesus wants why don't you bow down your head and let us pray confess your sins right now and repeat after me Lord Jesus Christ I'm sorry for my sins please forgive me come into my heart and be my personal Lord and saviour Holy Spirit please remove the stone in my heart and give me a heart of flesh of Jesus Christ remove my name from the book of death and write my name in the book of life Lord Jesus please intervene in our situations and give us love and happiness to be able to live our lives worthy of your calling heal them of their physical ailments in Jesus' name Amen I give you a quick follow up read your Bible daily and pray first before reading your Bible pray day and night and have family altar daily add fasting to your prayers as spirit leads you fellowship in a living church move away from your sinful friends be involved in Evangelism by preaching the gospel and by your behaviour show love to others care for the needy and under pr- privileged by sharing your goodies with them you are invited to our monthly prayer summit every second Saturday of the month may God bless you as you come the venue is LOHEM office now located at number one Ogunbiyi lane Ogui Enugu behind Fidelity Bank off Ogui road are these all that could be referred to as precious AM Express went to the streets to find out what's the most precious fluid different strokes for different people you would say to a country like Nigeria oil is precious because it is essential to life what oil is to Nigeria therefore is what blood is to man blood is an organ in the body and in fact the only organ that is fluid it serves as a transportation system for both good and junk things as it journeys through the body it comes in contact with tissues the heart kidneys liver and the lungs through its course it carries good things like oxygen nutrients and defensive herb it also carries junks like toxic carbon dioxide damaged and dying cells and other wastes blood in no doubt performs essential function to life hence the medical community practises transfusion of blood essentially to save life but some doctors or surgeons are not quick to transfuse blood why an estimate of two hundred million units of donated blood are needed worldwide each year blood shortage is common especially in wealthy nations because of population increase and the risky life style which exposes people to disease and parasites the blood compositions are white blood cells which constitutes less than one per cent of the whole blood it attacks and destroys potential wilful foreign matters the platelets which also constitutes less than one per cent of the whole blood form clots blocking blood exit from wounds and the red blood cells which constitutes between thirty eight and forty eight per cent of the whole blood these keep the cells and tissues alive by supplying them with oxygen and taking carbon dioxide away you will agree now that blood is essential to all human life and could therefore be called precious fluid the twenty twelve African Nations Cup match between Nigeria and Guinea scheduled to be played this weekend in Conakry has been postponed indefinitely the recent decision by the world football governing body FIFA to ban Nigeria from international football and also presidential run of elections in Guinea slated also this weekend were the reasons for the postponement Nigeria the national manager of Guinea beg your pardon the national team of course the Syli Stars Michel Dussuyer confirmed the news during an interview with a French football magazine this is a major bane to Nigerian football as- aspirations on the international scene and unless the FIFA ban is reversed the Flying Eagles and Super Falcons will suffer a similar fate later this month with the NFF having served a communique to FIFA yesterday and the world football governing body is still deliberating on the reverse of the action on the reasons based on the ban and recalling of the former Secretary General Musa Ahmadu who was previously sacked the withdrawal of a suit by the NANF led by Harrison Jalla against the NFF elections in a Lagos High Court which had drawn sittings to the twenty fifth of this month and reversal of the proposed twenty four team league format to the traditional twenty team format ? Bayelsa United Gateway Wikki Tourists and Ranch Bees confirmed relegated to the lower divisions by the NBL boards it is hoped that FIFA having sat on the issue since yesterday evening will take a position today variety they say is the spice of life such as variety in food clothes hairstyles and so on variety also abounds in nature perhaps that is why all people on earth belong to different types of skin colours from white to yellow and to black our living environment is said to account for the different skin colours we have in the cold climatic regions such as Europe inhabitants tend to have a lighter complexion due to the cold weather whereas in Africa darker skin is better suited in the hot and humid climate however many people these days bleach their skin why do they do that really is fairer skin more appealing than the darker skin despite the desire to look more appealing health experts say people who indulge in skin bleaching run several health risk ranging from mild skin burns and discolouration to severe conditions such as cancer liver and kidney damage they say most skin bleaching products contain one of the two active ingredients hydroquinone and mercury which work to lighten the colour of the skin areas to which it is applied by killing off the melanin making cells it is also the active ingredients in fade-off creams for freckles age spots and so on skin bleaching destroys the black pigments found in the epidermis that is the top layer of the skin exposure to the dermis layer underneath the epidermis layer to the harsh weather will increase the incidents of skin cancer the dermis cannot compensate for the absence of the epidermis and coupled with the hot sun one will get a higher risk of cancer some of those creams may contain up to more than two to five per cent mercury that will be harmful to health in the modern appearance conscious society in which we live there is a myth that lighter or paler complexions portray beauty riches and success but many beauticians and doctors advise that eating healthily exercising and using body creams which do not have hydroquinone mercury or steroids will produce more fascinating effects than applying mere bleaching creams to bleach or not to bleach is it worthwhile to risk the high chances of causing damage to our precious skin in exchange for a perceived view of beauty what do you think about Overado local government on Thursday twenty third of September two thousand and ten in its final project the project which put smile on so many people's faces involved a career talk and donation of exercise books to three different secondary schools schools who benefitted from the project include Obopala secondary school Asoro grammar school and Etuan College meanwhile the two thousand and nine batch C will be passing out on the fourteenth of October while the two thousand and ten batch C will be resuming camp on the twenty sixth of the same month thanks for staying with us Corper's Corner continues it's still Corper's Corner on your heartbeat FM nine two point three independent radio it's the character count segment enjoy it on character count today we shall be talking identity the Oxford dictionary defines identity as who or what we are the reason we need so many different versions of ourselves is that we live in so many different environments each of which demands a separate identity we unconsciously develop new identities to adapt to new situations or relationships over the years this identities mature new you emerge as circumstances call for them the most common one of the identities that we all have are those that we cannot live without at the very least you need a version of yourself for friendly relationships fellow relationships one for work and finally for God all our identities evolve pretty much the same way look at your life hard enough and you will see crucial points when you unconsciously develop new identities from your first day at school your first day on a job your first day as a baf every situations or environment requires us to somehow fit in so we shape an identity that does and then work at polishing it up the question of who you are depends on how you reconcile all your identities and whether or not they are in harmony with each other your many identities can speak and act as differently as you like as long as your core beliefs remain consistently the same I am Sekina Fayomi Corper's Corner continues Carlo Ancelotti is hoping Chelsea's World Cup flops will bounce back from the summer disappointment to win the Champions League this season Ancelotti has set his sights on the European glory after guiding The Blues to the Premier League and FA Cup titles last term the Italian believes the Chelsea players have flopped in South Africa will be eager to put that disappointment behind them and help him achieve his dream all my musketeers including Didier Drogba Florent Malouda Frank Lampard and John Terry have played in a World Cup which has lowered their profile Ancelotti told his son in my first season with Chelsea we won the Premier League FA Cup and Community Shield but I missed out on the Champions League so that is now my dream the former AC Milan coach also revealed his fear at not winning any major trophy this season saying he knows that if The Blues do not keep winning things will soon change for him Rangers' coach Walter Smith believes the Ibrox side performance against AEK Athens at the weekend puts them in good stead ahead of the forthcoming Champions League campaign the Ibrox side was a pilloried for their European performances last season also finishing bottom of the group scoring just two points however Rangers display in the Sydney Stadium against the Greek side has given Smith hope better Euro results can be achieved this time around I think this match can serve as a dress rehearsal for what we will face in the Champions League Smith told the club's official website obviously there are clubs who are level above ourselves and AEK like Real Madrid and Manchester United but I think playing Athens has given us a good indication of what we will face in the Champions League it's the longest transfer drama for this year and it seems there is no end in sight for those involved Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger says Cesc Fàbregas still has a three more years to spend at the Emirates when asked about Fàbregas putting on a Barcelona jersey during Spain's World Cup celebration Wenger had this to say Argentine striker Ángel di María has stated his desire to win silverware with his new club Real Madrid as he revealed that he will give everything to ensure that the club return to their former glories the Argentine international was speaking after completing his first training session with Los Blancos during their tour of the United States during the press conference di María was recently returned from extended leave after representing his country in the World Cup in South Africa also discussed his joy at sealing his wish to the capital club my goal is to win titles and help Real Madrid to be great again when Madrid was interested I wanted to come here because as a child I had a dream of playing here now we have to think about getting better and give everything for the team Inter midfielder Wesley Sneijder has admitted that the current Real Madrid coach José Mourinho will one day take over at Manchester United before leading England to the World Cup Sneijder who was linked with the reunion with Mourinho and Madrid believes that the Premier League is still the Portuguese tactician's favourite league in football and that he dreams of one day returning long touted as Sir Alex Ferguson's natural replacement Sneijder believes the special one is holding out for the Old Trafford ? and will jump at the chance of managing the club when Ferguson calls time on his illustrious managerial career English football excites him more than any other football in Europe and I don't think it's a question of if he returns to the Premier League but when I think it's written for him to take over Manchester United in a few years one great manager will retire and another one will take over Heineken the premium brand that erm proudly sponsors the UEFA Champions League and for now really Heineken is in a new can wearing a new look same quality and same quantity as it were and erm of course you can only follow Heineken and the Heineken UEFA Champions League radio show all the way through to the finals next year at the magnificent

votes in Guinea's first ever democratic elections in June a run-off between the two candidates was expected months ago but the independent electoral authority CENI has yet been unable to agree on a date for the exercise until now officials say if October ten is confirmed as the date for the elections the Guinea Federation will write to CAF to have the game moved in the meantime coach Michel

alright before this game started erm I was just discussing with Folorunsho that erm well we don't seem to be getting that kind of support for the Eagles like we used to erm when the Eagles were really tick I'm sure the dismal outing of the Eagles in South Africa may have been responsible for this but then one thing is certain that we really need whether we are thinking if w- whenever the ship is sinking the captain must erm try as much as possible to rescue the ship so I consider the corporate bodies as responsible organisations who can really identify with the cause of the national teams not just the Super Eagles now erm Idris Adamo the marketing erm manager of NFF had cause to mention one or two things about the need for this corporate organisations to come out and support the national teams even the female teams under twenty women under seventeen and all that our under seventeen will be starting the campaign today as well so but then why have we not gotten that I think we sh- they should not shy away thank God for the few corporate organisations who are watching now identifying with the Super Eagles but we need many more of them in so many areas they will always come alright erm we'll soon be joining erm our team of commentators in Calabar for the second half of the game we could see part of the highlights of the first half but very quickly before we join I said this what I said earlier the course of what I watched with the South African  Bafana Bafana for instance whether they lose or not they get the full support and all that okay erm maybe we'll be discussing more after the second half erm Folorunshoo we return you now to the U J Esuene Stadium in Calabar where Nigeria's Super Eagles will be taking on Madagascar for the second half of the qualifier for the twenty twelve Nations Cup enjoy yeah yes yes we do need many more of them but much as we see that their corporate social responsibility they're also putting their brand name to your product erm and if you do have challenges like we did have erm in the preparation as well as the World Cup itself then it affects such organisation and that is probably one of the reasons why we have to do everything right to ensure that the brand of the Nigerian national team is almost always there in the best shape and form and if we do that then you'll be you'll be surprised what influx of corporate organisations that would truly really want to be part of what you're doing I I don't want a situation whereby it is only when we have a Nations Cup erm profile or the World Cup that everybody rushes into going to be part of it but if we do it right they will always come yeah alright whether we like it or not three points for the Super Eagles of Nigeria in that Nations Cup qualifier against Madagascar I think it's a good one no- not minding the fact that erm to me I think erm we've still not erm gotten the gotten there in terms of erm the quality of the game Folorunsho looking at the last erm second h- the last forty five minutes what do you consider obviously obviously yes well erm le- let's just thank God that we even have erm the three points at stake which is very important for us but what should we be looking forward to in terms of erm the next game against Ethiopia we'll be taking on Ethiopia th- we're in the same group with Ethiopia so erm we should at least make some more solid preparations towards that game alright well you heard it all erm from Folorunsho Okenla erm a former Super Eagle and also erm sports commentator and erm the coordinator of the national cultural carnival that will be taking place in Abuja in November I hope erm everything will be done to ensure that erm that erm cultural carnival will erm you know will be a kind of in cooperation with the sporting activities that we have in Nigeria today just like we had in South Africa alright so that's how it's been we'd like to say a big thank you to you for joining us don't forget we'll always be there when you really need it most and that's talking about the other qualifiers that will be coming up on behalf of the entire production team I'm yours in sport Ofeje Kodesau bye bye well the the the the first half was better than the second half erm but erm we expected erm more of the play in the second half but it seems erm they took their foot off the pedal and erm the Madagascans are ka- kind of came out erm be that as it may we have three points two goals but one would have thought this sort of match is where you get so many goals in case you might need them later as the competition progresses yeah that is what you would expect and I hope that will be done that is the essence of it all we try to bring everybody together for unity just like it was in the first half erm the mu- the Madagascans are getting the game taking the fight to Nigeria Danny Shittu Obafemi Martins for Nigeria Valentine Nwabili Danny Shittu a hefty kick into the opponent's area Kandy Rambelomasina it is Valentine Nwabili Kalu Uche cross field pass he attempts to do gets it right Chidi Odiah Ajilore Olufemi Mikel Obi the Madagascans have made some couple of changes and they have brought in Kigana who replaces Nandrasana Edgar Nomenjanahary Lalaina trying to find his man Nandrasana Edgar but Joseph Yobo gets there first Osaze Odemwingie Vincent Enyeama has to be involved erm somehow Osaze Odemwingie in the middle for Nigeria Kalu Uche Obafemi Martins Kalu Uche Mikel Obi across field it is Chidi Odiah does it easily beautiful skills just the way the fans love it here at the U J Esuene Stadium Chidi Odiah  ZSKA Moscow of Russia was trapped made a s- in Nigeria's World Cup matches in South Africa delectable skills free kick quickly done by Chidi Odiah Nigeria's corner kick some restless times for for the coach Jean Paul the Frenchman obviously not happy with the results so far Kandy Rambelomasina Kalu Uche does all the set pieces for Nigeria this one not really good enough to cause trouble Dastigana the new man for Madagascar Tovohery Nandrasana Edgar Nomenjanahary Lalaina for Madagascar beautiful footwork almost erm causing problems for the Nigerian defence but the experience coming to bear Michael Eneramo certainly offside the Madagascans back in control and that's Tovo- -hery making a good one down the flank wins a free kick Tovohery they're fighting hard now the Madagascans Tovohery Valentine Nwabili clears up for Nigeria Leleu Mark Leleu Mark Tovohery Dimitri Carlos Valentine Nwabili doing well for Nigeria Tovohery with the toe Valentine Nwabili Obafemi Martins Ajilore Olufemi Chidi Odiah what we have seen in this second half the Super Eagles seem to be having it erm much more under control in terms of erm the cohesion in their play they're stringing the passes erm to target it is erm really erm refreshing for the home fans to see them do that for once it seems Nigeria really at home and leading by two goals to nothing well Ajilore Olufemi has done he's been he's had a pretty good game and Otekpa Eneji the Enyimba man who did very well in the other friendly game against erm South Korea in ? has come in to get his chance in a really truly competitive ? erm break for him in the national team Osaze Odemwingie on the left side for Nigeria he's gonna tease them with a cross in coming Kalu Uche in erm really a brilliant skill from him Kalu Uche an attacker which is really lovely footwork delectable skills plays for Almeria in Spain Kalu Uche scored two goals for Nigeria at the World Cup in South Africa hasn't scored any here but he has been a part of everything that's been good so far in this game delivering the set pieces he does seem he is the only one who is gifted in that area the cross coming in the goal keeper misses it Michael Obafemi Martins again gets his name on the score sheet for Nigeria but the goal keeper is down and maybe just maybe the referee wouldn't erm allow it it wouldn't count after all much to the relief of coach poor Obafemi Martins' header not really allowed to count by the referee well really looked a good goal well the referee knows why it wouldn't count It's still Nigeria leading by two goals nothing and not three Austin Eguavon really wondering why that goal would not stand Danny Shittu in the defence finds his captain Yobo Otekpa Vincent Enyeama yet to be beaten in the game a pretty easy game for him compared to the barrage of attack that came against the Super Eagles at the World Cup Enyeama getting involved kicks out Valentine Nwabili well it will be Madagascar throw-in John Mikel Obi doing what he knows how to do best shooting the ball and keeping it under close control John Mikel Obi Kalu Uche Michael Eneramo well the Eagles will have to watch very well keenly closely so that they don't concede a very painful goal that will count a really really for something great for the Madagascans especially on the away goals rule Danny Shittu who gets there first another substitution the second one for the Madagascans it's Ubidi a real s- hatchetman the ballman the attack for them that's given way Fahid Acham he is out of it now he could play no more part in the game and in his place is Norokarolos Norokarolos has gone in to test action an attacker for an attacker erm really shows how much the coach Jean Paul wants to achieve by way of erm shoring up his attack to get a goal here yeah well you expect they're two goals up already but for Madagascar they're not erm in a hurry to to give up they still want to contest for every ball they still want to see you know if they can you know just get a consolatory goal in this match because a goal in this match would decide what will happen afford the ticket to the next round of this erm competition don't forget that it is an a hope and away format so it is not really erm two goals erm to nothing that means you've qualified for the next round of African cup of nations erm qualifier for a place in Gabon Equatorial Guinea you've got to win convincingly at home to make an investiture a mere formality in a fortnight yeah it's still erm still a dig-down affair erm in the midfield  this is can this be a chance for the Super Eagles of Nigeria and Obafemi Martins could not get to the ball and the ball loses its touch by a throw-in the referee says the throw-in is for the Super Eagles of Nigeria and not for Madagascar Valentine Nwabili is going to take that well what we see the first change on the part of the Super Eagles of Nigeria erm jersey number eighteen Eneji Otekpa is coming in for jersey number fourteen Femi Ajilore and Nigeria loses possession to Madagascar here can the Madagascans pull one back I've always said it inexperience has been their erm greatest undoing you know each time they break into the attacking third of the Super Eagles of Nigeria and so far we've seen just one substitution for Nigeria and erm
well just what the fans love to hear here
of over one hundred and fifty million soccer loving fans
the fans loving it in the background you can hear the cheers
 are pour into a cylin- cylindrical drum sixty centimetre in diameter diameter huh right how deep is the oil question now is how deep is the oil in the drum how deep the depth and what is the depth depth huh  the height the depth is the same thing as the height if I take a jerrycan of erm of petrol pour into a drum then the question now is how deep is the drum depth the height of the drum is totally is totally simple if we say please listen if we if volume of a cylinder is equals to five R square eight then shh please can't be able to establish that cage huh however calculating the height calculating the height indeed height is equals to what then volume over what five R square is if we are to calculate the height it means the volume will be different so it will be volume over five R square and similarly similarly calculating calculating radius take will also be R is equals to what volume over what five inch take the square root plus we have to remove that square this square removing the square means we have to take the square root on both side so if you're to calculate radius this is how you will work it  just take the square root of the volume over five eight but yet we are calculating the height so we are going to use this erm formula yes I think we can continue from there we can't alright yes now volume is this huh what is this volume this volume is already digit this is what ninety nine litres so we're having ninety nine litres because of twenty seven over huh what's the radius thirty the height which we are looking for yes we have to change this one to centimetre yes remember the relationship we've established how many centimetre  make one litre one thousand we will multiply ninety nine by one thousand okay this times this itself will give us nine hundred yes  this one is over one so we now transpose we transpose this to multiply this this times this is nine nine zero zero zero times seven twenty two times nine zero zero eight divide both sides by twenty two times nine zero zero divide here also twenty two times nine zero zero so that this one will go this one will go this zero cancel this this zero are you there nine here's one nine here's one one zero twenty two here one twenty two here is five so we're now left with five times seven yes sir yes sir yes sir four cent- four centimetre yes sir nine point six forty cylinder four point one times four point no two two seventy one five zero forty five two five two one point one one four five one eight four five one eight four five one eight four one one two point nine five one  one zero two point nine five one  five five one four hundred four hundred centimetre square yes yes sir huh what is your ? what do you aspire twenty two metre cube one seven yes yes  no no yes J S one gallon is it gallon J S one volume yes twenty two kilolitres twenty two kilolitres twenty two kilolitre twenty two kilolitre two million twenty two million good good one ? times it's twenty two kilolitres now kilolitres two litres come and join me yes yes yes sixty six ninety nine ninety nine ninety nine thirty thirty times thirty height ninety nine thousand ninety nine thousand ? it's already calculated nine thousand nine hundred zero four centimetre ten centimetre si- four five zero seven eight two four eight two nine seven point six seven point erm two two no three three zero zero three hundred three and the rest four point one okay let's go to the next question what he said to Jesus in verse two shows that the man was interested in the things of God how true is this how true is this okay let's first of all find out what he said to Jesus in verse two then we want to know whether that shows us that he was interested in the things of God halleluja Alleluia so what we are saying here is that he was interested in the things of God because first and foremost that prompted him to visit Jesus and even from what he said that without erm God being with Jesus Jesus wouldn't have been performing those miracles he did there were other teachers around when Jesus when this story was written and erm those other teachers perhaps they only teach but there was no signs and wonder following their teaching but that of Jesus was different he not only thoughts but he also performed miracle so perhaps that made Jesus' own ministry astounding prompting Nicodemus to go and find out more about Jesus number three a what does verse three tell us about Jesus what does verse three tell us about Jesus verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God so what does this verse tell us about Jesus what does this verse tell us about Jesus praise the Lord for us to understand this very well let's look at erm revelation chapter two verse two verse nine and verse nineteen revelation chapter two verse two verse nine and verse nineteen mhm two two nine and nineteen yes read nine and also nineteen okay from here can we tell more about Jesus praise the Lord that is very very important Jesus knows us in total even when we pretend to be born again Christians and we are not really he knows us praise the name of the Lord he knows us very very well okay let's proceed what lesson can you learn from this what lesson can you learn from this okay so we cannot pretend  before God you may pretend before men and succeed but not with God Bible said that men looks at what outward appearance but God looketh what into the heart so God sees those secret sins that we commit and no other person sees it like in the case of Nicodemus Nicodemus wanted to pres- tend to be a righteous man identifying with Christ even though secretly but God knew him very well Jesus knew him very well that he was pretending and he gave him the message of salvation straightforward without missing mincing word that except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God so if we are if there's anybody here that is not born again I believe that God knows no matter how much you pretend about it God knows praise the name of the Lord the next question says what did Jesus tell Nicodemus in verse verses three and five verses three and five they say we should say this in one sentence verses three and five what did Jesus tell Nicodemus you should say it in one sentence verse read verse three and five whatever you make out from them then say it in one sentence what Jesus wants to tell Nicodemus okay sorry if you're asked in one sentence what was Jesus trying to tell Nicodemus period I think that is it for you to enter into the kingdom of God you must be born again and Jesus is saying the same thing to all of us here there is no short corner to the kingdom of God there's no shortcut to the kingdom of God you must be born again if you must enter into the kingdom of God praise the name of the Lord okay let's go further there's a comment here  as somebody sincerely accepts God's word the Holy Spirit uses the word to produce a new life in such a person as someone accepts what God's word the Holy Spirit what uses the word to produce the life of a new life in such a person that comment is very important because of verse five because Nicodemus was wondering what Jesus actually meant so Jesus explained it in verse five he said verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of s- the spirit they cannot enter into the kingdom of God they're trying to explain that water and erm spirit the water there is what the word of God so look at Ephesians chapter five where John was erm where Paul was writing the Ephesian church he said husband love your what wife as Christ loved the church you know and erm gave himself for it that he might wash it with with water by the word word by the word that he may present it as what as a living a church without spots or wrinkle or any such things praise the name of the Lord so the water there refers to what the word of God as you're hearing the word of God even as you're hearing it right now the Holy Spirit if you accept it in your heart the Holy Spirit uses it to what to produce a new life in such a person's life remember the topic is the new birth praise the Lord number five a says what is the importance of the spiritual birth what is the importance of the spiritual birth we're asked to also find the answer from verse three and five what is the importance of the spiritual birth that we're talking about verse three and verse five okay I like the way you put it you say that's the only qualification that one can get to enter into the kingdom of God okay that's the okay entering is a visa or green card it's a visa we give praise to the Lord so those that are dreaming of going to heaven one day must hear this they must be born again otherwise they will not see the kingdom of God not to talk of entering it they must be born again it's a must praise the name of the Lord five b outline four basic steps to the new birth four basic steps to the new birth does anybody know the four basic steps  to the new birth okay the first thing erm forgiveness of sin what comes first okay before confession what comes first repentance repentance yes confession then what's the next accepting Jesus as your personal Lord and saviour okay and what next are we guessing four basic steps to new births praise the Lord number one is that you must realise that you are a sinner you must realise that you're a sinner then number two you must what -s repent of those sins you must repent of those sins the Bible say that for all have sin and has what falls short of the word of God then we the second step he said that we must repent of those sins then the third one is that we must what confess those sins we must confess those sins and those sins we s- claim to have repented of must confess them and ask God to forgive us you know there's none that cometh to Jesus that he will what cast away he said come let us reason together even if your sin as what as dark as what as coal that he will make it as white as what even if it's as red as crimson that He will make it as white as wool praise the name of the Lord then the fourth step is what accepting Jesus as your personal Lord and saviour so those are the four basic steps realising you are a sinner repenting of those sins accepting Jesus as erm erm confessing those sins then accepting Jesus as your personal Lord and saviour number six and the last question before we go into the conclusion mention five basic signs of new birth in a person mention five basic signs of new birth in a person when somebody is born again what are the five basic signs that you notice in that person's life okay the person number one will will no longer be living the way he was what living before before praise the Lord there any other one the f- person will what profess Jesus we're not saying it in the order of erm how it is but it doesn't matter what about assurance of salvation and the feeling of peace in that person's heart person feel you know as if there's a load the load of sin in his life has been lifted by Christ and the person's have the person has peace in his heart not afraid of anything again the person knows that if anything should happen to him if he should drop dead right now that he he's going to a place of rest not a place of torment so that removes fear in such a person's life okay what more people around we mentioned three people all around will notice will bear witness that something has happened to such this a person such a person's life okay Bible say when any man is in Christ he's a new creature old things he's a new creature old things has passed away behold all things has become new if the person was a drunkard before he will no longer go to beer parlour if the person was a womaniser before and and goes out with harlots he will no longer go out with ballot- harlots if the person you know was a robber before he will no longer steal he'll no longer you know rob if the person was a liar before he'll no longer tell lies praise the name of the Lord so there'll be a total change in such a person's life is there any other one we can identify as a sign that marks a new life in Christ Jesus the person will have interest interest in the things of God interest in the things of God the person will have interest in the things of God the person will want to read his Bible every day the person will like to pray every day the person like to go for church or fellowship the person will like to you know go erm to where they are discussing the things of God praise the name of the Lord so these are some of the things that signs that mark a new birth of in a person conclusion as the physical life begins by physical birth so it is with spiritual life it begins by spiritual birth if you want to enter heaven you must be born again are you sure that you really have the spiritual life the memory verse is taken from second Corinthians chapter five verse seventeen second Corinthians chapter five verse seventeen I want us to all open to that place and read it together second Corinthians chapter five verse seventeen are we all there okay can we read s- together second Corinthians chapter five verse seventeen therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new again second Corinthians chapter five verse seventeen therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new can somebody read it without say it without reading from the scripture anybody okay beautiful can you try you've missed it therefore you missed it okay let me try second Corinthians chapter five verse seventeen therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things have passed away behold all things are become new let us pray we have heard the word of God through the study of the topic the new birth I want us to respond to God can we say that we are really born again have we obtained that new birth remember one of the conclusions we can derive from this study is that if we must make heaven then we must be born again are you interested in making heaven am I interested in making heaven then one thing is very basic you must be born again I must be born again why not talk to God right now okay the next I will also want to add you know one thing is if you have an interest you know in something there is this driving force that will push you to have a knowledge of that particular thing maybe you are interested in erm bone you know transplants you understand you begin to read books you'll begin to research on some of you know erm topics that are related to it praise the Lord so this man must have seen Jesus and he has seen really that there is something with this person so there is a need so for him to take that first step of visiting Jesus shows that he has an interest let's all start from there before we now look at his words here he said no man can do these miracles thou doest except God be with him so he really wants to do what to know more you know drive there is a driving force is that interest that is the driving force that really made him to ask that question without interest there is no there was no need for him to visit Jesus and there was no need for him to add question praise the Lord miracle verse three says Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God halleluja yes two two halleluja halleluja erm the lesson still goes same that God knows us our inside our outside whatever we do in the secret God knows our motives God knows you know what we have in mind even if we claim to be otherwise he knows so the lesson I'm gaining from there is that we ought to be careful how we present ourself before God we shouldn't present ourselves as hypocrites let me use that word in our hearts we're of different personality from what we claim to be outside so we should fear God in everything we do both in secret and on outside yes men but not for God no the outward appearance inward straightforward of God halleluja three and five they say we should join the two sentences okay let me read the two then make out and bring another verse three says Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee  except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God erm what he is trying to tell him that for you to enter into the kingdom of God you must be born again born again no short halleluja of God gave him with water by the blood blood halleluja halleluja it's very very important to it's significant in the sense that the spiritual birth gives us access to the kingdom of God I think that's the only qualification one can you know get in order to be allowed into God's kingdom that's spiritual birth so it's very very important okay so entering okay is it visa as in mhm like passport halleluja heaven halleluja confession it's all a- answering repentance okay right okay forgiveness halleluja good a sinner mhm real- realisation mhm mhm falls short of the glory of God scarlet yes snow halleluja yes halleluja the person will profess Jesus no but that's what it s- it is when somebody yes will be assured yes lifted from life how many how many have we mentioned bear witness that he has repented new halleluja is the baptism of what of baptism okay things of God okay pray halleluja yes Corinthians chapter five verse seventeen therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new second Corinthians chapter five verse seventeen therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new second Corinthians chapter five verse seventeen therefore if any man is in Christ Jesus he is a new creature old things have passed away behold all things are become new therefore if any man is in Christ new verse two says the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do this miracle that thou doest except God be with him I can say that this man Nicodemus had an interest in the works of Jesus because if you have a problem you have diffi- you are thinking of something we ask questions but because in his trial he is interested in Jesus works or who Jesus is or what he has seen Jesus doing that's what made him to ask that question so he had an interest in Jesus halleluja Alleluia I can say that Jesus is an omnipresence He is messiahs omnipotent so He knows everything about Nicodemus as a person so He knows in and out and Nicodemus that's why he went straight to him and said except a man be born again he can't see the kingdom of God so Jesus knows the man very well know the inbuilt everything about him and also you see Jesus Christ playing a role or witnessing in that verse so we also should be playing a role or witnessing in our own life time halleluja two two verse nineteen okay two verse two says I know thy works and thy labour and thy patience and how thou cannot bear them which are evil and thou hath tried them which say they are apostles and are not and found them liars verse nineteen verse nine nineteen says I know thy works and tribulation and poverty and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not but are the synagogue of Satan nineteen says I know thy works and charity and service and faith and thy and thy patience and thy works and the last to be more more than the first if you watch where I just read there's one phrase come on I know thy I know thy I know thy so it means that he knows everything about us like I said earlier number three of John so Jesus Christ know everything about us about Nicodemus he knows our works he knows our labour he knows our patience he knows that he knows whether we are fake Christians or not he knows everything about us there's no hiding erm place or no secret that Jesus Christ do not know about us that's the summary of  Jesus halleluja halleluja amen born again yes born again God amen spirit amen birth halleluja vers- verse three says you cannot see the kingdom of God we talk of entering but you cannot even see it you cannot ta- talk about us but with a visa is the the is it visa or what I don't want to  use erm  word want to use you understand or the passport you can't even  you can you can go anywhere without halleluja I know of erm seek forgiveness forgiving of sin confession repentance yeah repentance then confession applying faith halleluja a sinner yeah falls short of the glory of God snow amen his appearance and behaviour before halleluja it's a measure it is a ? he's a new man creature has passed away new amen amen second Corinthians chapter five verse seventeen therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new second Corinthians chapter five verse seventeen therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new second second Corinthians chapter five verse seventeen behold if any man he he he therefore if any man is a new creature therefore if any man is in Christ he's a new creature old thing new as we all know today a lot of students are eager to further their education and as such registering for one course or the other to make up what they have to enter university this is turn is because of what is happening the trend of education is very high now students are registering then you now have a lot of erm examinations board that take care of their their certification such boards we all know WAEC JAMB  NAPTEV NECO apart from JAMB the main purpose of all this erm examinations board is for certification purpose they give the certificate to say this person has done well this person has not done well but if you bear in mind that this certificate you you give you do not teach the students your own is just to give that certificate based on the fact that they have been taught in their various schools by their various teachers you're you're they've been taught in their various schools by their various erm teachers the only thing in order to achieve this thing the only thing the examinations board does is just to construct a test that somebody can now say  is standardised enough enable to enable the testify that what the certificate they are giving their student is very very okay we can now make up what we have been talking since so in order to achieve this thing we need to erm construct a standardised test one may ask what is a standardised test all these things all of us most of us read Education is not a new concept to us a standardised test in the actual sense means a test that lift up some standards such as you know the security of the test item as we are doing here not all of us are in conduction now you know some people are there because they feel that there are you know people that can keep our security tight enough then you now talk about the the misuse and use of the test result the confidentiality of the test result because when you are when the computer people are analysing their result people are not allowed to enter there its those people from the the computer assigned to that work so you are trying to safeguard the result these are the standards a standardised test suppose to meet and in all another form of standard erm standardised test they're talking about that to meet up that standard is when that test has been has undergone what you call standardisation processes in this standardisation processes   one you have to establish test norms there must be test norms that is the main factor when you are measuring a standardised test then a standardised test when you're talking about it the items must be constructed by experts in the various field which we are trying to do you invite your erm experts from the different places to construct item in your own area then a standardised test again we need to do item analysis it will mo- th- a standardised test must meet up this process item analysis where you're supposed to establish test erm diffi- erm the items that are very difficult the items that are very cheap that's what you call test analysis and the thrust of this paper is again the ite- the test you're standardising must be must have a high reliability coefficient and a erm must be valid and that is the thrust of this paper we're going to we're not looking at other processes we're looking at reliability and validity of a test then taking the word validity erm reliability is not really a new concept to us we all use it in our everyday life some people we say ah this information I hear from a reliable source all of us speak this English everyday what do you mean when you say something is reliable that you heard from a reliable source that means something that you can put your trust what do you hear something you can say anywhere when they call you anywhere the person will stand and say yes I maintain  what I said that is only reliable that's what that's a word reliable somebody can still say ah this your friend is not reliable that then is the friend your friend must have disappointed you in many ways that you cant even say again ah I won't trust this friend I won't trust this person that trust worthiness must be there that is the term reliable then other because you have different erm scholars in the field of measuring examination as time goes on everybody will come up with one definition or the other we have a lot of definitions for test reliability when you say a test is reliable you are talking about the consistency in the score not the measure alone if this is a test now we're not talking about the consistency of the test what we are looking at the consistency of the result in the result that test is convincing if you give out test now to a group of people they score high give them little time go back to tho- those people you know give them that test relatively if the test is reliable their marks will not be so you the erm  less it will the distance still will not be much that is what we mean by reliability that test is reliable the way it produces a consistency in the result then fo- you hear some people say types of reliability please we don't have types of reliability what we have types of reliability estimates you know before you can now say that this test is reliable  reliable there must be a statistical evidence to attach to that test and that statistical e- evidence is what is called reliability coefficient once a tes- because any test you you develop you must establish the reliability coefficient that will that's what the the experts is looking at they will say what is the reliability of this test you see if it has a very high reliability coefficient everybody will say ah the test is reliable and you don't just do that but expert like what we do here is not the normal thing what we normally do is not the we supposed to do the normal thing but because of time factor erm financial constraint they will be giving you excuses so if anybody asked you now what's the reliability of chemistry test unless you carry out that estimate the estimation process you won't be able to define the reliability coefficient or you won't be able to define what it is now there are types of reliability estimate methods we have first you are talking about test retest test retest method is telling us as the name apply you can even see it there test retest means you've given out a test for the first time you come back maybe within two weeks three weeks you still give out that test the same test again to the same group of people and you now correlate their result their score in the first test and their score in the second test and the formula is still there is what we call Pearson product formula you use it to test the reliability coefficient to see if that test is reliable mind you in doing this type of erm method using this type of method you don't need to extend the tests for so long because time factor may come in and that will affect it so but that may considering the nature of that type of estimate I don't think it's practicable here because since we are giving out this test for the final year students if we say okay let us give them out after scoring you will not find them again anywhere to gather them back to still give them again to say this is what you ha- they have done so I suggest we don't use it here but for knowing's sake erm for those of us who are doing research you can still use it in your questionnaire when you know that maybe some- somebody is doing questionnaire come here use you use erm maybe general education people in this TD and you promise you now the person now beg you that we are coming back in two week's time he still want to use general education people definitely as he has begged us any time he come here you will still meet some general education people those people that answered that test before so if now give the person those of us that test he  would now know our response in the first one and our response in the second one correlate the two using this Pearson product moment relationship that will now give us exactly the anything we find out there that will be the reliability coefficient of that test using that method and I say the the kind of the kind of erm application here the type of erm estimation you are using depends on the kind of the type of items contained in your test like most of us we use multiple choice and most of this things are multiple choice even the questionnaire strongly agree short short something that will just elicit information from people then another type of erm estimate erm estimation reliability we are talking about is parallel form this one is talking about we all know it here when we go out to construct our item we say bring two parallel bring four parallel do we really know what these parallels are talking about because if you are sayi- if you really want to use to estimate the reliability coefficient it means that when you go out there they will now use the table of question because I have already asked some questions there that will help us when we answer those questions we will be able to understand the line we are going so when you now ask we we need two parallels this parallel we are now talking about is the same content you follow the same table of specification you do everything you have two parallel that they're almost the same thing so if this one does not work this one will work but this ha- if you want to administer two of them this one is very very expensive you can but considering some factors too that will enable it not to be obtainable that one you have set A and set B you still do the same thing you can still administer the two sets at the same time some some papers are going on now they're asking to write about challenges how you can maintain erm manage erm examination malpractice this kind of erm method can be used when you present you construct two i- two sets of parallel at the same time  you now sure your group what these people are answering is different from what people are we use to curb examination malpractice so that if you are asking me mhm what is number one A A I will tell you my ow- if I now tell you the correct answer in my own you will now be looking at your own it's not the same thing this question is not so in that case now the the answers are different because we are taking different exams under the same condition under the same roof and the same parallel like JAMB people all high tech erm stake exams they use it when you go for some you know highly qualified and intelligent erm expert that set questions we don't for interviews you don't answer the same question but then they are all the same content area that is what we mean by parallel then another one is erm the the one you call split half when you are talking about split half from the name again these are all simple simple concepts you have your test instead of administering the test two times you can administer the test for the first one when you come back there will no time no money to ca- all these things are done after trial testing oh when you now come back instead of going back again to do it what you now do you sit down you now look at your items those of us that have fifty items in our own you now divide them into two  you split them into two halves two halves maybe we decide to have one by odd numbers even numbers you collect them so that it would be very easy for you two four six ten all the items two four six you now put them together all these ones you still put them together and you use what you call Spearman correlation erm coefficient erm method to look for that one whatever you see there will now tell you how reliable your test is then you have another one inter-rater that one is not commonly used when you have two judge two people rating a student on one test we don't normally use this one even with this erm erm split half we don't normally still use it because of we have a full test and we still want to get people using questionnaire most of them use this one so I always put where you can find or where you can use them so that's erm inter-rater parallel split half and erm what we call internal consistency this is where the the the action lies if you are looking for internal consistency as I said before the reliability must produce a repeated score when you're producing that resisted score in this formula you don't need to you need to administer the tests two of three times you are using a single test that single test you are using will give you all you want in this type of erm reliability estimate the kind of items we normally use here is the one we are doing here and the Gabumon and bona which erm Mister Omofoma has said because if actually somebody wants to carry out that reliability because he did not tell us the reliability coefficient of that instrument all we know is that the instrument is existing unless those of us that carry out the research that knows the reliability everybody here we don't really know  so if you want to do it you administer the test find the correlation between bona and Gabumon then because the the items are in sections that's the difference now I want to because the items are in section you have section A section B section B the kind of reliability coefficient you will be using here the method is cronbach reliability coefficient and the formula is there very erm the l- there's no light cronbach here is telling us that because of th subsections if you want to carry out the reliability coefficient of this paper presented here bona and gabumon will be talking about cronbach reliability coefficient estimate estimation because that one will now tell us take care of all the subsections in the in the test the formula is there for us then another type of reliability that we can get from this internal form we have tried when you say internal you're trying to stabilise a temporal stability to obtain a temporal stability so here now another type of internal consistency that we will be talking about is the actual one we're doing here if you're gi- after constructing our test we go back to the field to give them out for trial lets say when we come back we suppo- everybody supposed to  sit down you start working on your own this not matter of just  you know the formula is not matter of I didn't read the measurement book is a simple thing that everybody can do here the formula is there here you are talking about the internal consistency on one single test administration as we've gone out to construct item we come back we go out and do the item trial testing when we come back you now use the internal consistency using  Kuder Richardson twenty formula Kuder Richardson here the formula has been given where you have the number of item you have the the summation and the total item once you apply the formula there considering the number of i- test items you have you will get the reliability of the test so all these things we're talking some factors we will not be a- in the actual practice it is difficult to attain up to point nine reliability which is a very high reliability anybody can talk about if a test is somehow maybe between six and nine is very okay then it's not really practicable because of some factors that can affect that test and that factor is what y- what we want to discuss now the length of a test affects the reliability of the the the test you're doing like those of us that have forty in the normal process forty items is not a very good test length we can have fifty and above hundred is even very very okay as you have in English language if you use English now to do the reliability you will have a very good reliability coefficient because of the length of the test those of you you in technical just know it today that that forty items you people are using is not very good and when you carry out reliability you may have a very low reliability coefficient that can now anybody can say ah this test is not reliable if you go to internet you see some authors they will still tell you that test length is preferably from fifty upwards then another thing that can cause the test reliability is the psychometric indices which I call here the very easy items very difficult items they also affect reliability coefficient when an item is so cheap you have what we call ceiling and floor floor erm ceiling and floor relationship floor means that a lot of people will be on high they will score very high that is floor and that item is questionable then when you have ceiling effect a lot of people are down there's no light I would have drawn an X X like this you see some people are up why in in a a very good reliability test you don't expect many people to be on top there must be a moderate whatever then you don't expect a lot of people to be down that mean the item must be very very difficult that is why we suppose to be doing trial testing when you come back analyse your item when you see items like that it is removed automatically then those of them are not up and down can be reused and included in the in the test another thing that makes erm so here moderately difficult item is preferable moderately it will not be too cheap it will not be too difficult that will give you a very clue of the differences between erm erm high intelligent people moderate intelligent people and low that discrepancies must be there so that erm psychometric testing is very important then another thing that can affect it is what we call guessing if you see in JAMB or some  international test they will ask you any item you don't know don't answer don't answer we explained before because if you answer  you're on your own you're reducing your your own marks and at a- the same time it's not giving the test a good measure so the best thing what you don't know just leave it if they give us an item now to answer and a lot of us we don't know it we don't answer that will automatically tell them that this answer is very difficult but when you answer guess guess rightly it doesn't mean that you know it those people giving us the test will now assume that we know it and the actual thing we don't know it so tha- guessing is a ma- a a a very vital factor when you are talking about factors that affect reliability guessing should not even come up at all so when you are constructing your item you should be able to know when guessing will come in because when children guess and get it the test is not reliable at all so seeing this all reli- test reliability is all about and one factor there remains that for a test to be reliable  it is erm for a test to be valid it must be reliable so that gets us to the topic validity of a test so what's when you are talking about validity of a test we're simply saying when you say this thing is valid this thing is giving you the result you're expecting what you have in mind to get when you are when you are setting out the test if you say okay I want to maybe there's a lift there you want to test how valid or how reliable that lift is you now climb up you press you're on ground floor you press you're going to erm floor floor seven on getting on getting there you see yourself floor four you say ah this is not what I asked for you come back again I've experienced it you come back again you still press floor seven you see yourself in floor four may do it this thing now for about three times you'll now be wondering ah what is happening this machine is not you now say this machine is reliable but is not what valid because in the actual sense is giving you a reliable score consistency in the score the score is the same whenever it gets you there it will get you to four whenever it gets to four three consecutive times you were on four it is reliable because it maintain a consistency in the result but it is not valid because in the actual sense what you are asking is not what the test is giving you the the lift is giving you you're asking for floor seven but it's giving you floor four that makes it invalid that is the layman whatever I can't go beyond this so when you're now talking about validity you talk about a test measuring what it sets out to measure what do you want to measure in psycom- in psychometricians they have a way of doing that thing they don't measure everything the same time if they want to study you an aspect of you it's not everything about you they will study if you want to study how the eating habit of somebody that is a behaviour you start all the questions you ask will now revolve round your eating habit something that will elicit information about your eating habit and nothing else so that is what you are measuring here in our own now with the use of our table of content you already have what we want to measure how these children they have attained a maximum a knowledge they want to tell us whether what they have learned using what they have you know what erm what's giving them in the syllabus so when you are measuring using your erm table of specification you will now bring out all those content that will cover that thing you want them to measure if you want them to if you want to measure psychomotive erm ability psychomotor your use of hands and fingers and whatever to do whatever you want you ask questions that will elicit the information using hand if you want to use cognitive their brain how it works in it if you you do that nobody will say don't do that but you must know what you are measuring so that when your test comes back you will now know whether it is valid or not that is it then we have types o- it is here we have types of validity we have what you call face validity face validity now as some of you now carry this paper just look piam piam piam piam erm she knows what she's doing is in the line that's face validity you just can scramble through pia pia pia to you you are you sa- you are satisfied so we don't normally you know this type of validity has been abandoned by the psychometrician when you go to internet with recent information you can't nobody talks about this one  again but they keep on talking it because is one of the oldest form because if I should scan through now as am presenting this reliability you can see reliability you see erm types of reliability see this one you now conclude that is valid without going into it then that is erm face reliability another one is content that is where we have our work content when you're talking about content you're trying to draw an inference about the domain of scales you have your tab- that is why your table of specification is very very important you cannot talk of constructing a test without table of specification it directs you the content you have a lot of sam- erm content sampled in the the table of specification then what you now do to seat down know what you will write you start you know how you want it each as we did last time when you pick a topic a content you know you now ask yourself what is the weight of this content because some topics are heavier than others you agree with me and those heavy ones should be given a good attention because the weight of it is not the same thing with the weight of all so you should try as much as possible to bring more items from there than the other ones the ones you didn't cover you can now take it over to the essay mh you c- the ones you cannot bring out you can now take it to essay ask simple simple things there to cover it up because this is the most difficult you know aspect of test construction to to to construct essay is very easy but item multiple choice if you really know what you're doing I tell you to construct a good item you can use one week two weeks to do that so this issue of three nights six nights she doesn't arise at all it doesn't arise at all it is not it at all so people that really know what they are doing they should put them in a very good conducive environment A C that would be working on their head because it's a real mental work you know when you do it and finish you will now know that you've have really achieved something because you have to sample most of these things that is c- why you call it you know sample represent- representativeness because you have to sample all the contents there bring them in so that you know when you see it you say ah this test is very very valid it covers there is no way students will run out of it if you don't meet it in essay if you don't meet it erm OBJ you'll meet it in erm in essay you will not run out when you see people that construct item you will respect them you must meet it somewhere every every topic must be touched that is when you see some students they will be sweating because that i- you you are expected to cover your syllabus in your school you will sweat because you don't need to run away so that is the content validity we are talking about and I put some questions there let me just say is i- is there any clear statement they're all there I just put it there for us to know what will guide you when you are discussing about content validity you answer those questions when you answer them you now ask yourself the the the person you're bringing in is the person going to do this thing well for me is the person qualified all these things they're all there then you now talk about criterion related criterion stroke predictive when you say criterion as erm our acting erm our assistant director erm said the other day you give exam all these ones we're doing here no child you will say you come first no child you say you'll come second the certificate you give them you say criterion certificate you meet this standard you meet this performance you are using this for you to know that your test is valid when students meet that you know performance because now you see some students you say maxim- erm ninety per cent failure in English ninety per cent failure in this one at the end of this those of you in technical preferably they will say if you don't meet up this you will not be given the certificate because you did not meet that meet now is the criterion is now the the factor there I remember I'm not too clear about what happens in technical but I know that you're meeting up a criterion abi that if you don't have they will not give you those of you in typing you say if you don't have erm eighty words per minute you will not be doing this or that that is the criterion set then when you are talking about predictive you are using what you have now to predict to now say this thing will happen for the fact that this person does very well here it is going to happen that is why this erm post UME came up if you don't know the genesis of it because those students that will go to special centres to get erm scores very high score in JAMB they will now enter university people are still carrying out research they will now take the result of those people result of those people in their JAMB they will now correlate is a correlational study they will now correlate it with their performance in the work and see how that score they got in erm JAMB predicts their future performance that is what you call before predictive validity so if the correlation is high you have how you set it correlation study you will see there when you read your scores you will see the correlation coefficient if it is high you know that your test is what valid if it is not high drop it is not valid go back and amend and know what to do then the next one is erm you have your questions there read it up and see it then in the last view you still have what we call concurrent and construct they go hand in hand even though this one concurrent is telling us about  our current status now if you want to diagnose what is happening to me now to know my current status you know you will be able to construct item we are talking about my current status where I am now what is happening in me- what am what are you looking into me that you want to know anything you carried out now based on what you're seeing in me is what you are calling concurrent is happening now now then the last one which is everybody should know is construct when you're talking about construct you are talking about your biological traits the psychological constructs all of us we have different families where we come from what is obtainable here is different from what is obtainable here               if person now all these ones are not really our concern but for the fact that people are still running their programme for you to know when  you are talking about any type of validity you are talking we are able to you know defend your work because these are the things they will ask you why are you using cronbach alpha reliability why are you using this one you will  be able to explain is a very simple thing because once you don't explain they will now look at it that you copied and you don't know what you are writing so these erm construct the main one we are talking about here is the the content but this construct now we come in when we are talking about this bona and Gabumon because you are looking about the constre- the constructs of the individuals how intelligence and how they love this course how they do this how they do that so when you are talking about establishing the reliability and validity of bona Gabumon constructs should be there you should use construct validity to talk about bona validity the validity of bona then you should now use cronbach alpha reliability estimate to talk about the established erm reliability coefficient of the cro- erm bona and the   gabumon because they are in sections that is the main reason there so construct all of us know  how you like this how you hate this your interest is this your attitude how aggressive you are how intelligent you are how creative you are all these if somebody wants to go in details to know what constructs you have those things you inherited from your parents those things you ca- you know somebody can see and say ah he's doing this we now construct items to elicit informations about parts then after that you carry out this construct you know to find out how reliable it is we have seen it all that erm reliability and validity they're very important in any test measuring instrument we normally say test you see how measuring instrument questionnaire whatever you are using for us here we use erm test that test you've seen that it's very very important for us to know the reliability coefficient of our test and the validity of the test erm so these ones now you can only achieve it by knowing the relationship between the reliability and the validity as we said before a test cannot a less reliable test cannot be valid we've said it all before and a test can be va- erm reliable without being valid I've given example of that so that one is there we need other erm the relationships we are having there that will guide you to know and now ask yourself how reliable and valid is your test so in conclusion or my recommendation I first said that since our test is a standardised test they should allow us to do trial testing but in the absence of trial testing because of financial construct we should learn how to do what we call post-item analysis we can still do post-item analysis but that is that does not really tell us about the present reliability of our test but that will help us how it will help us is what I want to explain whe- what you call test post test that a test you've co- now that you've constructed this test I'm surprised that test items I constructed this year in chemistry is what they are using this year ia very wrong thing malpractice is there is a very wrong thing I was now questioning don't you have but they say they don't have at all say how can you construct item this year and you are still using it now now now now is a very bad thing and they were now telling me when you people go to the field construct about four parallel ? where is the money where is the time go back to your head in production let the they say erm we should make our proposal I say we so in absence of that we are going to do post-item analysis what is post-item analysis when we finish this exam now it is a very good thing we do and we learn this thing because is what we supposed to know it's not saying subject of this subject these are things we suppose to know so when when they come back after exam you will now write to computer Daniel knows what I'm talking about because he gave me one when I was doing my research they will print all this result how students answered all this result erm test item they will itemise from there we now sit down to do our to to establish our difficult exa- just to examine the psychometric properties of the test which are reli- erm the the the difficult index and the discriminatory index is it involves mathematics we should sit down and learn how to do it so that when you see why I say it is scores that will help us you will now record from your results you will now record all those items that you found out that are very very difficult that students fear so much you now note them when you now note them in the next item instruction people will tend to repeat such question or frame it in that line you will now tell them no no no I don't want it it is very difficult the last time student did not answer is one of when you read your reports you can still do it even if you don't know the post item the item when you read your reports they will still tell you item this is very difficult for students for the essay they will say a lot of students did not answer this question because it is very difficult it is above their standard this is a post-item analysis we can gather them put them up we can do it in essay read their their chief examiners' report when you read ? you know pick out all those items they reported that are too difficult that has K leg that has comma that has this one we keep them aside so that  in the next time we want to construct item when you see such things you will remove them immediately because it's going to repeat itself that is post-item analysis that will follow trial testing in the absence of trial testing then another recommendation I said there that when we are now doing this post item we are going to use Kunder Richardson twenty you still have what we call Kunder Richardson twenty one                                                           they're just the same thing only in the in the second one a mean of the scores has been given but in the Kunder Richardson the mean will be found then will now substitute it there then we've now said about content validity which is the one we're doing here thank you very much we have gone very far erm what we did last session we shall be reviewing them who can tell me what we have not touched yes accidentals very good what is accidental yes who can tell us what is accidental what is accidental nobody knows think about it what is accidental yes open your mouth and talk loud so that we can hear  yes signs in music is that all yes who can defi- yes could define it properly that is correct accidentals are used in music it to make the note higher or lower that is correct or who can tell me name some accidentals we have in music yes I said you speak out erm I said now name some accidentals  somebody have already  defined accidentals for us but what are the accidentals we have in music yes anybody that's taking must talk loud into my ear yes who can echo it higher what we have said yes at the back thank you very much you have just sharps sign flat signs then we have a natural sign those are the three accidentals from there you can have double sharp and double flat I want somebody to come up and write the and write that erm sharp sign on the board yes who is coming to write it yes write on the board a sharp sign class is that correct is that correct okay that is a sharp sign make sure this is revision you are taking your notes write today's own more work on JSS one revision JSS one first revision so make sure you jot them down and write out the sharp on the board and the name of the sharp is erm sharp sign the name of the sign is sharp sign now I put it down the the the topic or the heading on the board draw the sign on the board and name it to be erm sharp sign someone else has already told us that a sharp sign raises a note to be write the ascending tone write it down a sharp sign raises a note a sharp sign raises a note by a semitone a sharp sign raises a note by a semitone yes who can tell us erm oh no- no- le- let us say who can write on the board a flat sign yes please come and write it Essien is writing a flat sign on the board watch is he right you can write it two ways this is -on one of the ways you can write it there's another way we write it who can write it the other way a boy this time who can write it the other way no nobody a girl write it in the other way okay please try somebody say but can't you correct it or write it like this this this are the two ways you write sharp sign flat flat sign write it down write down in your then after the you have written a you have now written erm sharp sign flat sign then what else yes you know it this erm lady yes is that correct I told you no I told you do not call uncle uncle uncle because by so doing you will be eh  noise what did I say you should do give me a smile when you smile broadly and we are happy I will call you don't say uncle uncle and then make noise okay I think the boy was the boy was smiling very well I want to call him okay Queens is writing on the board now a natural sign is Queens correct that is a natural sign then write drawing now we have draw them and we want to still define the four stave to remind ourselves again a a sharp sign as we have said we have written that one now I'll tell you a sharp sign raises a note by a semi then what does a flat do to a a note yes raise up your voice speak speak up a flat a flat sign dis- erm decreases but well I want to use another lang- I want to use another language that is commonly being used yes is what he he just said who can put it more properly as we have we ha- as we have been saying it yes yes that is the right word a flat sign lowers a note by a semi tone then we're getting into the third erm data who can give us that the name of that accidental  so that I will not discuss today yes tell us natural sign say that everybody erm not shouting but say it loud now natural sign we have drew- we have drawn it on the board erm the all that we need to do draw write draw it down then define it who can define erm who can tell us what we use natural for in music yes yes who can tell us or who can put it properly now we have just explained yes okay that yes in other words we say a sh- a f- a natural sign restores write a natural sign restores a note that has been sharpened or flattened that has been sharpened or flattened in other words a note that has been raised or lowered back to its original position we are still writing put back to its original position then yes somebody to read that that that erm statement out so that other people correct themselves those who have not we're no- we're not able to meet up yes yes no start from natural sign good let u- let let us have a an example on the board it is in music this is a staff you have learned about a staff and erm but the treble staff are base erm  staff you can even call them treble clef or bass  now if I put a sharp here on the last line the fifth line automatically this stave is ca- is known as a G major G major has only one sharp written on the fifth line now this is G major stave so as I write on this line the second line that will be do because this place is G and G major will start from here because of this F sharp on the fifth line then if this place is do if I put another note here it will still be do but if I put another note next to that second note but with a sharp before it this sharp will I change into di it has raised the sound from do to so let us sing this one this is this note has four beat a whole note it is you can take it like this do then another the next note do then next one now will be di because that sharp has changed the pitch of that sound let us take the three dos then the la- the third one will be di one two three sing let us take it louder but with a correct pitch do do di let us take it better now one two three go now if we go further if this one is do what would this place be any yes chorus answer re this do this is re then this one will be re so you have three notes for re re ri I'll put a sharp the first note is ordinary re the second note with a sharp is now ri because if you put a sharp on re then it will not  it  will now go to ri the sound will sound ri because it has been sharpened by a semi tone now do do di then this one there is a natural placed on it before it it means this note have been restored the work of a natural it restores a note that have been sharpened or flattened but this note have been sharpened but this one now the natural has restored this voice again to the sound do this one will be do di do we're back to do one two three go a bit louder small one two three go you've cle- you are out of pitch if I say simply louder we must all go together with one pitch do di do take my do one two three go okay that is the work that is the working of erm of the accidental a a a s- erm a s- a sharp raises a note by a semitone a flat lowers a note by a semi then erm natural restores a note that have been raised with a sharp or lowered with a a flat back to its original  condition to its original pitch original condition okay having gone through all this we have written them down we move to something else what can you remember that is remaining in JSS one erm since last month we did last session we have not reviewed in this erm class yes time signature good time signature who can remind us about the definition of erm time signature who can remind us who can define time signature you do not learn to forget yes we are starting  JSS two with a thorough revision of JSS one work so that you can build on that from known to unknown so please I want you to define  time signature quickly yes time signature yes try I don't want to tell you to speak out you should be able to know you should know you should speak out anytime that somebody is talking you must speak out                          yes okay that is okay you have just given us erm simple duple erm simple triple simple quadruple you have not defined or explained what is erm time signature who can do that what is time signature okay write hence time signature time signature is a fractional figure fractional from fac- fraction fractional time signature is a fractional figure one written above the other time signature is a fractional figure one writ- written above the other written at the beginning of a piece of music written at the beginning of a piece of erm music written at the beginning of a piece of music time signature is a fractional figure written one that is one place above the other time signature is a fractional figure one written above the other one place above the other written at the beginning of a piece of erm music to show time to show time or movement in music to show time or movement in music listen this time signature is very very important in music it determines mov- the movement of erm any type of erm music you play or hear and erm and it de- it de- it it determines the movement that people will move along with the music if they are dancing for or with the mu- if they are dancing to the music for example you have four four four four will go goes like this one two three four one two three four one two three four one two three four that's how the music goes for that time signature then another one can be three four one two three one two three one two three one two three then another one can be  two four one two one two one two one two so you find that every piece of music has a time signature that determines the movement of that erm music so we want to talk about simple time signature we have two type types of time signature in music you have simple time signature and compound time signature simple time signature simple time signature make sure you write take down your notes simple time signature and compound time signature compound time compound time signature but in this class JSS two we are going to treat simple time signature and compound time signature we have started with si- simple time signature we'll go over compound time signature but let us review the erm first the the simple time signature somebody have already explained that we have simple duple in simple duple time signature how many beats do we have in a bar yes two we have two s- beats in a bar then write it down in s- simple duple time there are two beats in a bar there are two beats in a bar music is divided into bars so from each bar carries two beats in the time of erm two four or two two four that is duple time duple time exa- an example of duple time is look at it two four two eight two sixteen two thirty two two sixty four then let us let the small two four two two two two two four two eight two sixteen two thirty second two sixty four let me explain in two two time signature write first two that girl you are looking outside  you have never seen rain falling before two f- two means two minim beats in a bar this two under the two under is standing for a minim while the two above is telling you you have two minims beats in eh but let's try at it again this two above is telling you how many kind of note you have in a bar but the two below is standing for minim because minim has two beats also you have two two that's two minim beats in a bar now let me ask you a question if I have two four what does it mean to you yes two four yes somebody yes yes please that's four s- four is standing for crotchet that is a good answer two crotchet beats in a bar you have two eight two quaver beats in a a bar you have two sixteen what did that yes to you two semiquaver beats in a bar what of two erm two thirty two two thirty two that is a kind of note yes yes two demisemiquaver what of two sixty four yes okay say it louder okay but these erm these notes are so small that they are not they are not used in erm music but for theory you need to know them the ones that are curr- commonly used in music is two four and erm two two okay so all these are examples of erm simple duple time write them down simple duple time e g write them out they are all examples of simple duple time quickly quickly you have finished writing that we now take erm simple triple time what is simple triple time to you quickly quickly yes somebody yes in triple time we have three beats in a a bar write it down in simple triple time there are three beats in a bar write you're not writing in simple triple time there are three beats in a bar in simple triple time there are three beats in a bar now with what is on the board you should be able to give us example of simple triple time yes somebody who have not spoken since yes yes okay no you don't say over because it's not mathematics is not we are not doing maths and you must not draw a line in between the the figures so yes three four what does what is the meaning of three four to you what does it mean to you three four okay okay no you are dealing with three yes three crotchet beats in a so write three four write it down three four means three you have three crotchet beats in a bar is standing for three beats in a bar and that the beats are crotchets three four means or sto- erm stands for three crotchet beats in a a bar what of erm three eight yes yes three quaver beats in a bar three eight accidentals yes sir accidents are signs in music accidentals are signs in music accidentals are signs in music that are used to either raise or make musical note higher or make them lower ?   you said meaning of

everyone I would like to welcome you to this class and as you've remembered or let me bring it to your memory that in our last class we talk about learning and when we talk about learning I talk about the ingredients of learning and I told you it's as if if you want to prepare a stew or a soup there are certain ingredients that you need for the soup to be tasty and a- remember that I told you that the two major ingredients when we talk about learning is behaviour and experience because the general definition of learning is a relatively permanent change I believe you still remember that a relatively permanent change in behaviour as a result of experience so experience and behaviour is the key thing they are the two major thing that we need when we talk about learning remember when there's no change in behaviour there's no learning and experience too must be involved so when you want to prepare your soup remember soup erm salt is very very essential so behaviour a changed behaviour it may be negative or positive I believe you can still remember that and also we talk about the stages of learning I told about three different stages the acquisition stage the reten- the the retention stage and the recall stage and when we talk about acquisition I'm just trying to bring it to your memory before we build on the last foundation because you need to know this at all time when we talk about acquisition stage you acquire new skill acquisition is from the word acquire and when you get something it is something that is new you don't know it before and there are certain ways of acquiring things but we will not go into that in order not to waste our time the second stage talked about the retention when you have something new you keep it you retain it that is the retention stage and whatever you acquire remember I told you certain things or certain ways of acquiring and when you acquire something and it is not properly kept definitely that thing will go away so retention stage is very very important when you acquire something it must be retained and lastly what we discussed in our last class is recall stage whatever you have acquired and you have retained you should be able to bring it back to memory you should be able to bring it back to memory and that is what we know as recall stage today by the grace of God we are going to proceed from where we stopped and remember too before we I proceed when have we talk about recall stage we have two types of retention and the first one is short-term memory and the other one is long-term memory the short-term remember I told you is also known as active memory while the second one which is long-term is deep freezer memory I believe all of us we've seen freezer before so long-term memory is also known as deep freezer memory today by the grace of God we want to proceed by talking about the types of learning we have types of learning types of learning and I would like to discuss five different types here the first one is habitual learning in some text books don't be confused they have it as habit learning or associative learning we are all talking about the same thing whether it is habit whether it is habitual whether it is associative it is still talking about the same type of learning and when we talk about habitual or habit or associative learning it is an automatic response pattern elicited by a particular stimulus situation something cause it from the word habit habit is what you do what you are used to or what you see somebody do and you copy it a particular habit some of you you formed the habit of chewing and the second person will be hearing it it is habit it is from the word habit we have habitual something is associated to it you know some people if they want to describe you they will say ah the girl that walks and drag his feet or her feet or the boy that walks and bend his chest or the shoulder to one side or the other that is habit what you have you you've cultivated to be part of you so we talk about habitual learning or habit or associative learning I proceed by telling you about the second one which is trial and error learning this is very very common with artisans and this is also known as insightful learning I would like to you to always note all the other names that each of these learning types is being called because in case you are given objective question you be able to tick the appropriate answer now trial and error learning also called insightful learning it occurred when the learner is faced with a completely new situation in his or her experience let me go back to artisans let's use a mechanic or a radio mechanic yes a radio mechanic or a car mechanic as an example for instance you know all their sign board around here they will tell you they specialise in Benz in Toyota in whatever th- y- whatever brand of car you can think of but they don't know everything they're just doing trial and error Mister A will get to them okay please eh I notice a particular sound in my in m- my in my car they would say ah don't worry sir we will fix it they don't know the exact thing but they will try to check different things touch different things and God help them when they touch the correct thing they've learned by error or through trial and when another person maybe Mister Z now comes again that I have I've been hearing some sound the thing they did to Mister A's car they will do it again and when it works they've learned through that so anybody that comes from Adam and tells them that okay-o I have a particular noise in my engine they know where to go to not that they know it not that they're being taught no but they arrive at the solution they learned such tasks or such skill through trial and error I believe you understand this erm example given I would like to read this to you too common example can be gotten from artisan I've said that before most especially mechanic or radio repair workers they use this method when vehicles or gadgets that are not used that they're not used to were brought to them for repairs you know nobody will want any customer to leave his or her shop without gai- gaining something from them so whether they know or they don't know they will still try to explore different means to solve the problem in order to enrich themselves trial and error that is the type of learning now the next one remember the first one is habitual or associative learning followed by trial and error the third one we want to talk about is schematic learning schematic from the word scheme schematic learning and it is used or it is it it is a kind of learning that is being-based or let me put it this way it is an organisation you know you you have previous experience that you built on you've had some informations before now the new information that you are acquiring you are building on the previous knowledge you have I believe before you know two letter word you've been taught ABC in your primary school you start from A B C and so on and so forth and later your teacher in your kindergarten class I believe you can still remember they will now tell you okay two letter word now if you don't know A it will be difficult for you to build on two letter word they don't just jump from it and I'll give you another example a mathematical equation the quadratic equation if you don't know one plus one for you to now solve quadratic equation would be terrible you'll find it miserable in any mathematical class so schematic learning it is the use of organisation of past action that form the bed seed or the seed bed rather the seed bed for interpretation and development of further learning you are building on what you've previously learned and the proceeding from the familiar what you know it is better you some if you don't know it it will be very very difficult for instance now in our school presently there are some courses that if you fill them in first semester you will not be able to register for them in the second semester because they're the bed seed for the course in the second semester I believe you are following me now we talk about rote learning rote learning is so common to students and when we talk to wh- when we talk about rote learning I would like to call it cramming if you know when a an exam is being announced or a test all of you I I always see you around reading cramming okay let me just cram it and I will pour it I will give it to the lecturer just like that if you ask any student immediately after the test or after the exam such a student will not remember because it is being stored it is a temporary storage and immediately it is used it is forgotten so when we talk about rote learning it is a type of learning that occur that occurs for a particular purpose remember I said about I talked about test or examination so whatever you are learning or whatever you are reading okay let me just know it so that Ms ANON will do it will mark me and w- I will I will scale through Mrs ANON's test so rote learning is a type of learning that occurs for a particular purpose which may lapse within a short time remember it will not last long it's only for a short time for instance some people after a particular test if you ask them okay tell me the formula they will tell you I don't know but if you go and check their script you'll see that they have a correct formula why because they just store it th- and immediately they dump it in on their script the thing has gone into the thin air now most students use this type of learning especially in preparation for test it is the condition it is a conditioning process where a learning material learned to be relatively short lived it's span is relatively brief because human brain is not designed for long-term verbatim storage this is very very bad of any student that cultivate the habit whatever you want to learn learn it appropriately so that whenever you're being called upon to use such knowledge that you've learned you be able to recall easily it is difficult to recall remember our stages of of learning we talk about acquisition we talk about we talk about retention and we talk about recall stage so now we g- go further no ma we go further we go further to vicarious learning vicarious learning this is the type of learning that is acquired through observation the type of learning acquired through observation or imitation of another person you know some of us we learn by l- watching movies some of you you know how to dance by watching people that dance on your television some you know how to fight by watching all sort of cartoons where they fight where they beat themselves now when we talk about vicarious learning it's also known as what social learning social learning you socialise you learn it from people for instance now if you're asked how do you know how to prepare rice for the ladies in the class if you are being asked I believe most of us you would tell us that okay it's because I observed my mummy cooking rice some people if you ask them how do you know how to drive as a as a boy most of you they would say okay I observed daddy driving and me too I tried it one day and it worked so observation learning is also known as vicarious learning another thing you can also call it imitation you copy something for inst- s- for instance some people you know the way they dress you know when you see daddy Adeboye now and you love him so much you will now say okay the way daddy dress he always put on short sleeve and you too you want to pattern your life to a- erm to resemble that daddy way and you too you always be using bow tie or wear short sleeve we are talking about vicarious learning here because it is from what you have observed what you have watched it is one of the best way by which children learn for some people their they they they they're abusive in school why because they saw their parents abusing themselves or quarrelling this is a very very easy way of learning so we need to watch what we do we need to watch or to screen what you watch on the television not everything they're transmitting that we should watch on the television learners are observers when you observe something whether negative or positive even if you don't use it now you will still use it because it has stored in your memory now we have advantages of learning advantages of learning learning enables individual to fit into a particular vocation if you are being asked I believe majority of you you would tell me you want to be a doctor you want to be a nurse you want to be a lawyer it is what you learn that will assist you or enable you to fit into a particular vocation and by fitting into a particular vocation it will enhance your development it will help you to con- contribute your own quota to the o the development of the society and apart from that it will earn you a living that is number one it will earn you a living your vocation will earn you a living the best way to achieve this is to equip individual to cope with changes we need to learn we need to learn we learn on a daily basis either positive or negative but positive learning will enable us to fit into a particular vocation also learning assist people either young or old to develop understanding about their world and equip them with eagerness to go on learning for instance now if you learn ABC and ABC you built on it by learning three letter words two letter words and you see that you are really gaining from what all that you are learning definitely you would desire to do what to continue learning for instance you learn a particular vocation and is bringing in money you now know that there's another course that will enable you to earn a higher money definitely you do what you will go for such so that is what it assist people to understand you understand things going on around you you will not be a novice if something is happening in China yes yes yes I have the knowledge that it is happening in China and this is how to help the China citizens and when you now contribute your own quota and people praise you for that you will feel good you'll be happy to do more or to learn more in order to be of help and in order to win the heart of the world to yourself this point is also important learning increases the ability of the learner it increases the ability of the learner whatever you don't know you don't know there's no magic or two way about it so when you learn it increase your ability it increases your skill lea- learning also encourages learner to express themselves and become more appreciative of another of how others do the same for instance now when you learn a particular thing it encourages learner to express themselves you know the potential in you will only come out when you put into practice what you have learned if you don't put into practice what you've learned definitely your potential will just be like that some people they're taught how to how to how to sew or how to make a dress but by practising it you know some inspirations will be flowing in too some ideas will be coming too definitely it will encourage them when they now design a new cloth and people praise them for that you know they've encourage themself they've sustained their skills in thinking it helps them they're not just dogmatic not what they're being taught that they just carry on like that you know our foreparents they wear iro and buba but presently we have different shapes different designs of skirt and blouse it is because some people some people they they they develop themselves by doing what practising with the small knowledge they've received or the small thing that they've learnt they develop it and by cutting the cloth in another way they're able to give us beautiful designs and now we pay heavily because they call it designer clothes and we all rush to buy those designer clothes may God help us to learn good things in Jesus name learning assist and encourage individual to assume responsibility for their own life it makes them to it makes them an independent individual and a contributing member of the society if you are a doctor definitely you're helping yourself and you're helping the society at large because when you find yourself in the state hospital or wherever and somebody comes to you to for treatment definitely you treat the person the person gets better the person is appreciative that you've rendered help and you too you are being paid for that humanity service so learning es- assist and encourage individual to assume responsibilities in their for their own life and even in the life of others learning permits and allow learners to l- live to earn a living a good life it depends on whatever you learn if you learn the bad thing definitely you'll end in jail because if you learn how to steal through vicarious learning you saw some people stealing and you too you want to copy them or you've already copied them definitely you'll be caught and you'll be sentenced to jail you will not be able to earn a good living like that but when you learn a particular trade or you learn a particular vocation or you are doing a par- you you are focused on a particular career definitely it will help you to develop yourself it will help you to earn a good living you know we have ordinary living and good one and you know it depends on whatever we learn and I believe we've all learned the types of learning remember there are five now I want to talk about another thing that is very very important and when we talk about this it is a major thing in psychology because there's no psychology that you'll talk about that will not talk about this theory we have different theories we have so so many so so many but today here we want to talk about Ivan Pavlov Ivan Pavlov classical conditioning Ivan Pavlov cla- erm classical conditioning another name for Ivan Pavlov classical conditioning is respondents conditioning or Pavlovian conditioning Ivan Pavlov is a Russian psychologist and to be precise he was born September fourteen eighteen forty nine this date is also important because if you're given objective question and multiple answers for you to pick if you don't really know you will pick you will tick the wrong option so once again September fourteen eighteen forty nine is the year Ivan Pavlov was born and also remember Ivan Pavlov is a Russian psychologist Ivan Pavlov died in the year nineteen thirty six these dates are very very important to me I would like you to know them so that you'll be able to tick the correct options during your test or the erm semester examination and now I've told you R- as a Russian psychologist he he he developed the theory called classical conditioning and another name remember is Pavlovian or respondence conditioning there are certain things that you have to put in your head for you to be able to give us the real picture of how Ivan Pavlov arrived at his own theory remember I told you that we have different theories in psychology and classical conditioning is one of the theory and when we talk about classical conditioning I want to use a layman example now you are combing two things I'll still define it but listen carefully when we talk about classical conditioning you are pairing two things together you are bringing two things together and let me use this example for instance if you are okay i- i- if you are given a meat pie how many of you will salivate you can see the number of hands now I know all of you will salivate salivation is normal to every living being at the sight of something good if you know that I will come to class with chocolate definitely you will salivate when you see me but we are not going to that now when we talk about cla- erm classical conditioning Ivan Pavlov performed a particular exper- experiment using dog using bell using torch lights to arrive at what we call classical conditioning for instance now if I come to class with cane how many of you will salivate no hand up okay now he did the same thing you know dog they love meat cats they love fish but let's go back to dog because Ivan Pavlov used dog Iba- Ivan Pavlov observed that at the sight of dog sorry at the sight of meat every dog will salivate just like every human being will salivate at the sight of meat or meat pie or something good even fried rice at the sight of fried rice I tell you I will salivate and I know all of you you have different things that we salivate to but now that we talk about Ivan Pavlov Ivan Pavlov performed this experiment using dog it is natural for dog to salivate to either meat or bone but it is unnatural for dogs to salivate to the ring of a bell or to the sound of a bell now what did he do in his experiment okay before I go further let me quickly define classical conditioning to you so that you be able to understand very well classical conditioning may be defined as a process of pairing neutral or unnatural stimulus with a natural stimulus to acquire the result or the characteristics of a natural stimulus remember the example I was trying to to to to to cite now when you present a dog with a meat the dog wi- naturally salivate but when you ring a bell no dog will ever salivate you are bringing two things together associating two things together connecting or bonding two things together to give you the real result now what did Ivan how did he erm perform his own experiment Ivan Pavlov rings a bell and almost immediately presents the dog with a meat he r- he that was done repeatedly over months later he observed that even without the presentation of food the dog will still salivate meaning that the dog has associated a relationship or has has has developed he he has learned that even without dog I know Ivan Pavlov will always present me with food immediately the bell is being rung now it is a connection between food and meat to make the dog exhibit the natural stimulus you'll be hearing the word stimulus do you be hearing the word conditioning don't get yourself confused they are simple simple terms when we talk about natural stimulus natural stimulus meat is natural stimulus because at the sight of meat every l- human being will do what salivate at the sight of a fried chicken I will do what I will salivate and I know you will salivate as well so when we talk about dog now it is natural for dog to salivate at the sight of meat but it is unnatural it is highly unnatural for dog to salivate to bell but when Pavlov now combine meat and bell together he still arrive at that same natural response the natural response is salivation so we'll be using that those terms regularly as we discuss more about Ivan Pavlov remember i- classical conditioning is the formation of an association you are forming it it is not there before it is not normal you want to bring out something normal from an abnormal situation it is not normal for me now to now salivate at the hearing of a bell it is not normal but when I I now salivate when a bell is being rung behind me or in front of me or anywhere it means I'm doing the abnormal thing but why am I doing the abnormal thing I'm doing it because I've learned it because I've associated something good with that particular thing so when we talk about classical conditioning you are establishing a relationship a connection a bonding between stimulus and response something must stimulate you and when you are stimulated definitely you will respond to every stimulus there must be a response I believe you are following me now when we talk about Ivan Pavlov remember he use dog he use m- meat and he use bell presently when we learn things the food is the unconditioned stimulus in your test or in your exam too you should be able to differentiate between unconditioned stimulus it is unconditioned because it is natural unconditioned is also natural salivation it is natural too but when the dog salivates to the ringing of a bell it is conditioned stimulus why because the dog has already established a relationship between food and bell and whether the food is presented or not the dog will still do what salivate so salivation at the ringing of a bell without the presentation of food will turn the salivation to conditioned response please don't get yourself confused here food is unconditioned stimulus salivation if it is pr- erm produced as a result of food we have unconditioned but if it is as a result of bell we have conditioned stimulus this is where we're going to stop by the grace of God in our next class we continue by introducing another erm another another experiment also carried out by Ivan Pavlov have a wonderful day erm we want to what do you th- what do you think erm is referred to as indigenous knowledge when we say indigenous knowledge informal mhm I didn't say erm indigenous education I said indigenous knowledge yes yes ANON you want to say something
Give your husband our love and regards.
    Word that loving your husband or wife is a commandment, which is 
yeah most people will always love to do snow fights
we're supposed to express love in our daily life in our actions in our words and everything 
express His love to express myself 
 who defied the rain sun and security threats to queue patiently to be registered and on election days spent hours to be accredited and after voting waited for the votes to count to ensure that their votes counted in their choice of leaders these sacrifices and the massive turnout of the people at the elections is a clear signal never will again never again should the Nigerian people accept manipulated elections to throw off dubious and irresponsible elites who are self-serving and unaccountable to the electorate the message is the resolve and commitment of the people during the elections is clear perform in the interest of the Nigerian people and the nation or be thrown out there is need to consolidate on this to signal a break from the past however comrades it is not yet Huru we still need electoral and constitutional reforms which will ensure that candidates with significant votes are also accommodated the state of the nation of the economy in the past one year comrades the national economy has continued to underperform although the economy is said to have grown at the rate of over six per cent unemployment and poverty have remained as critical challenges facing the nation inflation has been on the rise reaching a current rate of twelve point eight per cent although the cris- the crisis in the banking sector has been moderated credit for the real sectors of the economy has remained inadequate the naira has continued to depreciate even though the Central Bank has publically rejected the former policy of devaluation devaluating it the depreciation of the naira is directly implicated in the rising inflation related to this is the cost of basic services electricity tariff the cost of electricity to the consumer has continued to rise with further upward review contemplated this month even as the electricity le- regulatory commission has recently ruled that consumers have have been subjected to illegal charges or meter maintenance for years with ? on commission to ensure that consumers are credited the full cumulative amount of such service they were subjected to unemployment comrades we have chosen to focus on the theme of discrete of job creation and people's welfare in this year's May Day because as we have emphasised in the successive May Day addresses over the years unemployment remains one of the greatest challenges facing our nation since the last May Day we have used every opportunity of engagement with government to demand that it tackles the problem of unemployment the federal government has set up a committee on job creation and has recently held a one-day job summit several state governments have instituted programmes of job creation while all these are commendable the reality is that the unemployment challenge remains very daunting we call on Mister President to urgently adopt policies to tackle unemployment in particular the number of unemployed university graduates does not only constitute an unfortunate wastage of human capital but also constitutes a major threat to a stable social order while interventionist and targeted programmes can help to ameliorate the problem in the short run the long run solution to the unemployment problem lies in nurturing a national economy which is buoyant balanced and stable jobless growth in the past few years the national economy has has been growing at the impressive rate of between six and seven per cent annually what is clear however is that such growth has not led to real development unemployment and poverty have continued to deepen what we must seek is balanced and inclusive growth this raises the issue of underlying philosophy which governs economic management in our country what is needed is a developmental state that will lead to the creation of our economy that is people or- centred one that promotes true development and not jobless growth and an economy that does not concentrate wealth in a few hands but one that leaves all out of vulnerability and destitution the minimum wage comrades the struggle for a new national minimum wage has been long drawn you will recall that during the last May Day celebration the agreed minimum wage of eighteen thousand naira was announced with a call on the government to quickly pass it into law unfortunately it has taken almost a year for the amendment to the minimum wage act to be passed now that the law has been passed we must commit to ensuring that the law is observed and that the new wage is implemented we have had some discordant notes that some of the state governors about it not about that some of the state governors are talking about inability to pay the new minimum wage on our part we know that all governments and private sector employers covered by the law can conveniently pay the wage in particular in the particular case of government what is called for is a reordering of priorities and reduction in waste and grabs calls have been made by some governors for a review of the revenue allocation formula in favour of the state to enable them have some access to more resources to pay the new wage while we agree that positive developmental impact can arise from the erm deconcentration of resources this cannot be a condition precedent for the implementation of the new minimum wage comrades a major task ahead of us is to ensure that th- not only is the minimum wage implemented quickly in the both in both public and private sectors but also to ensure that the implied adjustment of the general wage structure is undertaken as quickly as possible on this note I must add comrades that even those governors who claim that they cannot pay to be involved and be better informed now that this has been signed into law and that there is nothing anybody can do about it any governor who claims he cannot pay the minimum wage of eighteen thousand as provided for by the laws of the th- federation or of the nation will as well relinquish his job and allow someone else to take it the cost of governance continues to weigh down on the national economy we call on Mister President to take urgent steps to address the issue of the of remuneration and other perquisites of political office holders we must use the opportunity of his fresh and overwhelming mandate and the window of the transition to deal decisively with this matter it is clear to us that the creation of a new Nigeria which is equitable jobs and development o- development oriented is not possible if this issue is not resolved our legislators' and indeed our elected public officers' pay must reflect the reality of the average earning in the economy in order to ensure this there is need for the setting of the salaries of political office holders to be moved to the national salaries income and wages commission so that the same underlying parameters can be used in establishing guidelines for all public sector employees and elected officers moreover there is need for transparency such that the salaries and other perquisites of such public holders office holders are matters of public knowledge and not shrouded in secrecy budget implementation and performance related to this is the political game which has continued to undermine the national budgetary process in recent years budget execution and performance have fallen victim to an unhealthy of- competition between the executive and the legislative arms of government over what magnitude of resources to control budget implementation and performance im- is in mandatory terms bear no correlation with physical project execution on the ground every year huge sums are budgeted for projects and programmes with nothing concrete to show for the expenditures the state of our roads and other infrastructures continue to remain dilapidated and dysfunctional constituting bottlenecks to national development corruption the problem of corruption which continues to hold back any meaningful development in our nation needs to be addressed as endowed as we are with human and natural resources these resources now appear like a curse a major reason is corruption can we today in good conscience say how many barrels of oil are actually pumped from our reserves many fear that a huge number of barrels are unaccounted for or in quote privatised daily huge allocations running into billions and trillions of naira are meant to power development growth agricul- agricultural and other sectors annually without meaningful measurable corresponding impact comrades we must work with other patriotic forces in our land to reverse this negative process underd- underdeveloping our nation we call on Mister President to refocus and reinvigorate the national anti-corruption agency furthermore we call on the government to reevaluate the underlying princ- erm philosophy of its economic policies opening up our domestic producers to unfettered competition from abroad through policies of trade liberalisation and other neoliberal policies at our state of development cannot be the way to develop our economy government must review the lifting of the import prohibition on certain categories of textiles toothpicks and other products while in the last few years the international situation was saturated with the global crisis financial crisis engendered by rabid capitalism today the world is confronted with the result and commitment of people to dismantle dictatorship in all its rami- ramification this wave of short change has brought across twenty north African and Arab countries including Egypt Algeria Tunisia Libya Morocco Yemen Bahrain and Syria in all these cases the people carried out mass protest against not only sit-tight leaders but also self-serving policies that promote ine- inequality and social injustice comrades support the struggle of the working people in these countries and hope that these experiences serve as a lesson to Nigeria and other countries whose ruling class believe in the continuous oppression of its people with obnoxious policies that exacerbates poverty and social injustice in this regard we wish to acknowledge the struggle of the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic whose land has continued to be occupied by Morocco we call on the international community to use the opportunity of the wave of change in the African and Arab world to gain independent and free the Western Sahara people from the colonial clutches of Morocco we we insist that the ongoing restin- restiveness in Morocco and negotiations with the monarch must put the freedom of the Saharawi Arab democratic republic on the agenda we commend the people of Cote d'Ivoire for regaining the mantle of leadership from former President Laurent Gbagbo on assumption of of office by the duly elected President Alassane Ouattara the African Union ECOWAS and the United Nations must be highly acknowledged for doggedly standing by the people of Cote d'Ivoire to restore the mandate of Outtara this defence of the outcome of credible elections by the international community should be a lesson to African dictators and sit-tight presidents that the wave of change is certainly irresistible let us also use this occasion to acknowledge the struggle of the Cuban people who have over the years suffered under the yoke of socio-economic embargo by the United States we call on the Nigerian government ECOWAS and African Union as well as the international community to intensify pressure on the United States government to free the Cuban people through scrapping this strangulating embargo in conclusion we wish to pay glowing tribute to all those who lost their lives in the course of participation in the last elections we have already taken a minute silence in honour of those departed colleagues especially the youth corpers particularly members of the national youth service corps who died in the process of defending democracy and serving their fatherland our hearts go out to the families of these heroes of our democracy who are mourning loved ones we are determined even ever than before to promote and defend the rights of our people to ensure that these patriots did not die in vain once again we thank Mister President other government officials employers and members of the diplomatic corps for commemorating the May Day with Nigerian workers for our allies in the media and civil society we sincerely acknowledge your presence and again commend you for the support given to the labour movement in its struggle for a better society finally we commend very specially the Nigerian workers for their unflinching support for the leadership of the Nigerian Labour Congress and Trade Union Congress and for their faith in our ability  to deliver on their on the mandate they gave us long live Nigeria Labour Congress long live Trade Union Congress long live Labour Movement long live the Federal Republic of Nigeria thank you very much we receive sun light throughout the day for every day throughout the year we receive enough rainfall to make our soil fertile enough such that if one throws even a grain of maize anywhere in the country it will geminate all the natural disasters that create havoc and bring sorrow and grief to so many people in different countries of the world do not occur in our dear country earthquakes volcanic eruptions hurricanes wild fires destructive floods snow storms are not experienced in our beloved country we enjoy a unique location we are placed almost halfway between the east and the west the north and the south of Africa indeed Nigeria is at the centre of the African continent our population is so large that one out of every seven Africans is a Nigerian indeed we are truly the heart of Africa even our natural endowments are so enormous we are one of the largest producers of cassava in the world some few years ago Nigeria was the largest producer of palm oil in the whole world in the past our groundnut pyramids marked us out as a major and important producer of agricultural produce our coal reserves are huge the- there is hardly any major solid mineral that is not found in commercial quantities in our dear country our large coastline is washed by the Atlantic ocean our dear nation is supplied fresh water from t- our two major rivers Niger and Benue with many of their tributaries fellow Nigerians Nigeria has no good reason to be poor we are so blessed that we need not go outside the country to pursue the good life unfortunately the past twelve years have been very difficult for our dear nation many things have gone painfully wrong things have gone from bad to worse which should not be so much funds found its way into the purse of our dear nation in the past twelve years the prices of crude oil and natural gas a lot of our public assets were sold within this period yet it is difficult indeed very difficult to show what the revenue realised was used for our economy has sunk beyond imagination election rigging has killed the interest of the electorate in voting and substantially reduced their willingness to participate in the electoral process yet unemployment has translated into such vices as armed robbery drug abuse trafficking in persons assassination raid kidnapping cybercrime and corruption failure to supply adequate and regular energy to power our existing industries have resulted in the closure of most of our industries and forced others to relocate to other countries in Africa this unfortunately has made the growth of small and medium enterprises virtually impossible worse corruption in high places has reached a scandalous level it is common knowledge to all that poor infrastructural development has made transportation and communication a very difficult task the breakdown of law and order has promoted the insecurity of lives and property just as the falling standard of education has reduced the value of our academic certificates many people can no longer defend the certificates they have sitting in one's room certificates can now be bought with money it is also sad that poor health care delivery has made our health institutions mere consulting clinics thereby forcing those who can afford it to go outside our country to get treatment even for more common diseases including  even catarrh fellow Nigerians the trouble with our country is simply that we have not found people who know what to do to better our beloved country we have not had leaders who put the interest of the nation first and above other considerations we are yet to find those who truly fear God and realise that power is a public trust held on behalf of the people imagine that Nigeria is rich and yet Nigerians are poor we are yet to have those who are prepared to galvanise and utilise the talents that abound in our dear country to solve many of our problems as a nation we have not found in good numbers men and women of good conscience those who treat others fairly and justly those who not only preach the golden rule but practise it fervently do unto others what you would want others do unto you we in the new ANPP are determined to show Nigerians that many of the problems that confront our country can be solved we want Nigerians to realise that we have the power we need to change those things that we do not like that have happened to us in the past this we can now do with our votes if we look carefully and listen attentively we will be able to choose the best people who will serve us well and help in solving many of the problems confronting our beloved country fellow Nigerians friends of our dear country we in the new ANPP believe that regardless of the enormity of the problems confronting us as a nation we shall overcome we do not lack the will to do so we do not lack the men and women who can help us achieve those things which we desire and deserve and because we care for Nigeria for a very long time we had begun a search for those patriots in our fold with the qualities that can enable our beloved country rediscover herself and pursue her manifest destiny in the committee of strong prosperous and powerful democracies of the world this evening ladies and gentlemen I am happy to let the world know that at last indeed at long last our efforts have yielded fruit as we have found two God-fearing wise men who will help build a new Nigeria of our dream most distinguished Nigerians friends of our beloved fatherland they are his Excellency Malam Ibrahim Shekarau the Sardaunan Kano the governor of Kano state teacher union leader administrator and democrat he is our great party's presidential candidate as governor of Kano state he has been able to bring peace to a state that used to be a hotbed of violence in the past eight years that he has served the people peace has returned to the state thereby showing an exemplary ability to rope people together irrespective of religious differences as a consensus builder Malam Ibrahim Shekarau has given a strong sense of belonging to all Nigerians the residents in Kano state by appointing many non-indigenes of the state into key positions in government this has strengthened people's faith in their citizenship rights and help new people feel tha- feel at home in Kano state it is important to point out that before he became governor Kano state had serious infrastructural problems especially in the area of water supply as soon as he was inaugurated into office he faced the problems squarely and was able to find solution to this problem that have confronted the state for a very long time on the other hand is our vice presidential candidate his Excellency Chief John Odigie Oyegun former governor of Edo state technocrat and seasoned administrator of unblemished record a man with a wealth of experience he rose to the highest level in the public service he has served our beloved country creditably in various strategic ministries and he's therefore knowledgeable about the problems of our dear country as governor of Edo state he touched the lives of many people by solving many problems and monumental challenges that crom- confronted Edo state during his tenure he won the admiration of his people as a result of his passion and devotion to their welfare their happiness and their progress lastly this great Nigerian was a freedom fighter for democracy to flourish in our fatherland when democracy was threatened in our nation a few years ago he did not keep quiet when it mattered most he rose up to to be counted and fought hard enough for all Nigerians to be free fellow Nigerians I ask you to judge these two gentlemen based on their record especially in the various positions they have either held in the past or are holding at present as we move into the field for our presidential campaign in the next few days we in the new ANPP urge you to lend your ears to these two wise men as they say what they would do for our beloved country to be better again as it should be if need be join issues with them ask them questions about what they would do for our country to become a modern nation demand from them their vision for a more prosperous more secure more peaceful and more united Nigeria in the new millennium and beyond our great party's other candidates in all elections beginning from the state houses of assembly to the office of president will soon move into the field to meet with you to canvass for your votes and to seek your support our two wise men who are running for the presidency will tackle head-on the various problem that confront our nation I appeal to you to listen to them they are men and women of honour and integrity we in the new ANPP keep our promises we say only those things we intend to do we do those things we have said we will do in a few days from now in the ancient and historic city of Abakaliki the capital of Ebonyi state the new ANPP will have its first national flag day flags will be given to all our gubernatorial candidates as well as our presidential candidate what we are doing this evening is the official kick-off of the presidential campaign of the new ANPP for a new and modern Nigeria from this day onward our presidential candidate with his running mate will travel to all the states of the federation to meet men and women boys and girls the poor and the rich letting them know that with their support certainly help is on the way I appeal to all Nigerians to have an open mind and take a good look at the candidates of the new ANPP examine what they say and cast your votes for them I give you my word of honour we will not let Nigeria down fellow Nigerians we in the new ANPP are determined to place Nigeria on the mountain top we are hungry to win elections we in the new ANPP desire change because we know Nigerians deserve change we ask Nigerians to give us the opportunity to reinvent Nigeria and return her to the path of renewal and rebirth in a fast changing world in the three states of the federation we govern we kept faith with the yearnings and aspirations of the people in Kano state we have shown how transparent and God-fearing leadership can transform the lives of the people in Yobe state our great party has driven the engine of development such that remarkable progress have been made in virtually all areas of human endeavour in Borno state we have delivered and kept the flame of progress and happiness burning aglow despite serious distractions we ask Nigerians to give us the opportunity to do for Nigeria what we have done in these three states this would be difficult to achieve if we do not encourage competition in the political process for twelve agonising years one political party has misruled our beloved country for this long length of time it has been the same tale of woes broken promises shattered dreams incessant power failure increasing armed robbery and kidnapping bombed explosions mass poverty terrifying hunger and joblessness the time has come for Nigerians to try another political party to provide a better and more focussed leadership for good governance to flourish in our homeland there is no better way of choosing between two alternatives except when we try to find out which of them is better the new ANPP is that option we urge Nigerians to give us a try and see whether the difference will not be clear at this juncture fellow citizens friends of our dear nation permit me to comment to comment on a very disturbing development in our beloved nation in the past several months many things have happened that worry us many things are going wrong we see very worrying signs showing that our democracy could be in danger promises made that the forthcoming general elections will be free and fair still remained mere promises the enabling environment that will ensure that the vote will count and the voter will matter in the forthcoming election is yet to be seen in Ebonyi state a recent rural election into a house of assembly seat for Ohaozara west constituency shows that all is not well for our democracy before and during the rerun elections supporters of our great party were harassed brutalised and intimidated gun shots were rapidly and sporadically fired into the thin air with brazing impunity by our opponents this frightened so many residents and created serious health problems for those who were already faced with the challenge of high blood pressure security agents eventually drafted to contain the situation on election day looked the other way as various acts of electoral malpractices were carried out at the end of the exercise the electoral process was abused and the true will of the people subverted in Zamfara state members and supporters of our great party have been unlawfully detained on trumped-up charges by security agencies those who became fed up with the manner they were governed in the state and decided to embrace our great party were persecuted for no just cause in the past two months our members in the state have been s- ceaselessly attacked and assaulted by thugs believed to be sponsored by our brothers and sisters of the other side it has been a reign of terror in the state for our members who continually suffer unlawful incarceration and brazing intimidation to make matters worse our party's secretariat in the state was completely burned down by yet to be identified persons variable valuable properties were destroyed in the inferno indeed our members in the state live in fear not because they committed any offence but simply because they belong to a political party of their choice what a pity that this can happen in Nigeria of the twenty first century the situation is not different in Gombe state the campaign office of our great party's gubernatorial candidate was turned into a battlefield with gunshots fired into the building it was by the special grace of God that he escaped unhurt also his residence suffered a similar fate even in that case the policemen who went their forgot a pistol and a tear gas canister his supporters have not been treated any better it is rather unfortunate that this can happen to a law-abiding citizen who committed no offence but only presented himself for elective office on the platform of our great political party in Kwara state only a few days ago the campaign billboards and other campaign materials of our candidate in Sawo Essa Igbodun state house of assembly constituency in Offa local government area were destroyed the perpetrators of this act not being satisfied with their crime went further to threaten our candidate with assassination the story is endless our woes are many whenever we are s- wherever we are strong and at the heart of the people a disturbing scenario emerges the cloud of danger is building up as acts of violence threat to life harassment and intimidation become the unacceptable order of the day this cannot continue it has to stop all these are very disturbing a situation like this puts fear in our people it prevents them from participating fully in the electoral process it vitiates the important need for a conducive environment for free and fair elections to take place we can no longer have any good and acceptable reason to explain why Nigerians cannot freely and fairly choose those who govern them the federal government must act decisively to ensure that every citizen no matter his or her political party affiliation is treated fairly and justly our dear country belongs to all of us no one or group should be allowed to be above the law all acts of intimidation and harassment aimed at instilling fear in the opposition political parties cannot help our nation in the search for credible leaders through free and fair elections also it has become increasingly difficult for a level playing field to be provided for all those who are running for elections in some states of the federation candidates of opposition political parties are denied access to the use of public media and public facilities this should not be so because erm these facilities belong to all citizens irrespective of differences in political affiliation any attempt to deny opposition political parties the use of these facilities can neither be fair nor just and certainly will not promote the spirit of competition in the political arena there is again that the stopping trend where many candidates in the ruling parties use public assets and facilities for their campaign this is not right it should not continue in many other countries that practise democracy this is not allowed such candidates when they use public facilities in promoting their personal interest or that of their political parties are made to pay for such services that is done in order not to put those in opposition at a great disadvantage the time has come to ensure that a level playing field is provided for all in the political contest how can those in a position pay for organising their campaigns and rallies from their own funds when the same cannot be said for some others fellow Nigerians we challenge the federal government to take urgent action to ensure that the opposition is not intimidated after all there can be no true democracy without a vibrant opposition it should take practical steps to reassure Nigerians of their safety it is a duty it is a responsibility it is important to remind those who misuse their position to intimidate others to realise and never forget that power is transient some day surely some day not too far from now they will realise that the only thing that is permanent in life is change fellow Nigerians let me reassure you all that we in the new ANPP are prepared for the journey that lies ahead of our dear country we're ready for a battle of honour we are ready for a fight of integrity on behalf of the Nigerian people we are resolute in our pursuit of a fair contest of ideas that will release our fellow citizens from the pain the agony and the misery that have befallen us in the past twelve years we do so knowing that Nigeria can be better again and also that Nigerians can once more wear broad smiles of enduring happiness and fulfilment i- on their faces which they desire and also deserve my dear brothers and sisters the stage is set the dice is cast as we move into the campaign field in the next few days we shall promise only those things we can do we shall tell you the truth as we have always done in the past in every village we shall tell Nigerians what we will do for each and every one of us to go to sleep at night with both eyes closed in every town we shall map out a workable plan of action for every child to be in school in every city we shall discuss our vision for our economy to blossom so that jobs will be available the sick can receive treatment in hospitals that work in every state we shall outline solutions through which the naira will once again find greater value to enhance the quality of lives Nigerians desire and deserve in these efforts we shall count on you fellow Nigerians for your prayers for your support and for your good will knowing that the happiness of all of us is the reason why those of us in the A- new ANPP are in politics on my part I give you all Nigerians my word of honour the new ANPP will help Nigeria solve many of her problems and build a new nation we all can be proud to call our own finally fellow countrymen and women I call on all leaders and members of our great party to rededicate themselves to the service of our dear fatherland the challenge we all face will be both demanding and tasking but I am confident that with hard work determination and faith in the almighty God we shall succeed we must remain strong united and resolute in our pursuit of a better life for all Nigerians no effort will be too great to spare no sacrifice will be too much to make make no mistake about it Nigeria needs the new ANPP the new ANPP needs Nigeria working together like members of one large family which we are I am confident that Nigeria shall rise from the ashes of today and become the guiding light of tomorrow showing the way for others to follow God bless the All Nigerian People's Party God bless our great country Nigeria thank you so much thank you for joining us on Healthy Wealthy and Wise today on STV my name is Ogbo Awoke Ogbo friends and family call me Ogbo the Great if you haven't done so already please connect with me today on F erm Facebook to enjoy lively discussions about success and to receive our weekly lectures for free please go to Unlock Your Destiny dot com and subscribe today we'll be discussing thirteen hidden messages in your personal history there are powerful reasons why you must know your roots compelling reasons why you must know where your parents and great great grandparents come from why is it fundamental to know your ancestry because you're a product of the genes of the past generations genes pass on coded information from one generation to another you still have the genes of your great great great grandfather who died in seventeen ninety five and you bear listen to the mysterious stories those genes are telling you I did not begin to realise the importance of knowing the family roots until my son once brought back erm an unusual project from school his school asked them to draw their paternal lineage down to the fourth generation I discovered to my great shame that beyond my immediate parents I knew next to nothing about my forefathers three of my grandparents erm had died before I was born and my grandmother died in nineteen seventy four when I was still a little boy so I began to dig out pieces of information about my forefathers I was able to trace my paternal lineage down to about eighteen forty erm it was no small journey into the past since there are no photographs or written records but it was extremely rewarding there were peculiar stories about my grandfathers that made me proud of who I am unfortunately the only thing some people think about their ancestry is how their forefathers worshipped idols and poured libation because of this they threw away all the positive blessings about the men and women from whom they descended when you peep into the bible you'll find many genealogical passages like this one begat this one and that one begat that one why do you think the bible emphasises human ancestry the new testament even began by tracing the minutest details of the human ancestry of Christ to be disconnected from your ancestry is like a broken chain now you may ask me how about people who don't know their father who their father was perhaps a randy French man came to work with an oil company in your village one thing led to another and your mother become pregnant for the oyinbo man he promised to take your mother to France after you were born but the foolish man disappeared before you were born that's how you became a stranded French citizen in Nigeria ask your Mum for details about your father if your mother is dead ask family members for the truth about who you are and where you come from by the time you ask seven people you will receive a revelation trace your father if he is dead find out and visit where he was buried and establish connection with his family each time I travel to the US or Europe I run into dozens of Nigerian children who are neither there nor here they're comfortably lost in another country when you suggest them to return home they refuse to consider the possibility it's very true that economic reasons oppression and war might force a family to seek refuge in another country but my opinion is that anyone who has lost the sense of where he or she came from has lost a significant part of their being worse still some parents are ashamed to teach their children their native language it's estimated that seventy five per cent of our languages will disappear by twenty fifty the easiest way for young children to connect with their roots is through their mother tongue some people say it doesn't matter but it does now here are thirteen coded messages in your ancestral history and erm your village or of origin number one you need to un- erm the past to understand your present you need your past to understand your present Confucius the great Chinese philosopher said study the past if you would divine the future what I'm going to say next might surprise some of you coming from me but I guarantee you that Nigeria will not get better until we revisit our history you can rebrand Nigeria all you can compose beautiful rebranding music but until we ask ourselves where we are coming from how we want to remain married to each other and where we want to go we're just delaying the evil day we lack a sense of history and this is the real Nigerian tragedy as I studied the writings and speeches of Lord Luggard Azikwe Awolowo Mbadiwe and a few other colonial writings I was shocked to discover that the very same problems we are trying to solve today as a nation are the same problems that they grappled with the Nigerian problem was set up in nineteen fourteen since nineteen fourteen we have never known peace or witnessed progress but shamefully no leader in this country has been bold enough to look nineteen fourteen in the eye we're hoping that nineteen fourteen w- will just go away through rhetoric and rebranding but if you rebrand trouble it is still trouble if you dress a monkey in agbada it's still a monkey there are many stumbling blocks in Nigeria's chequered history that have not been confronted as a result each successive generation stumbles in exactly the same place for example the British colonists admitted that they manipulated Nigeria's first census figures and they confessed why they did it that historical k- stumbling block is responsible for much of the injustices and inequality in Nigeria until you move that stumbling block we will continue to hear the deafening cries of marginalisation around the country another hefty stumbling block is the Aburi Accord a big lion that will still wake up one day and yet another stumbling block was the nineteen ninety nine constitution we think our fundamental problem is corruption but corruption is just an offspring of the main problem our problem is structural how can a nation bedevilled by so many stumbling blocks and fault lines survive why did Gowon create twelve states at the time he did why is it that Nigeria has never progressed better than when we were only four regions and a weak centre what does the discovery of oil have to do with Nigerian politics suppose the oil was discovered in a different part of the country how would the federation have fared nobody wants to ask this inevitable history questions so we keep fooling ourselves but we might never fool history for so long in America no matter your field of study you won't graduate until you complete a course in American history but in our case a professor told me erm that erm there's a thirty year old Nigerian student who did not know that Nigeria fought a civil war a nation that does not know its past cannot embrace its future the same thing applies to you as an individual if you do not know your past you will not master your future number two the hidden code to unlock your powerful ancestral legacies every ancestral family has unique abilities talents and skills in my village there are blood lines that are expert in trading I know a family that trades kola nut that's what their grandfather did that's what their father did and that's what they're doing they can hold conversation with kola nut that you and I know nothing about we also had families that were expert in blacksmithing palm wine tapping music and so on my father had great musical talent no wonder I learned and started playing the guitar in only six days yet I know people that have been trying to play the guitar for twenty years when it comes to cognitive abilities some families are excellent planners and organisers some are experts in diplomacy and peace making and others are great in inspiring and leading people to accomplish great things now chances are that if you find out the skills talents and abilities that run in your family you might have a clue about your native abilities you are not aware about these powers now because they exist at your subconscious levels but when you discover these skills and abilities running through four generations in your ancestry it's like striking an oil field you can cash into the revelation well here is where we will stop today join me next week for the continuation of the hidden messages in your ancestry if you want to attend our erm April twenty third coaching class please send an SMS to the number on the screen to receive this lecture by email go to www dot Unlock Your Destiny dot com until next week I am Ogbo A Ogbo I love you remain healthy wealthy and wise Excellences ladies and gentlemen I stand on the existing protocol I stand before you to read the speech of General Doctor Samuel Osaigbovo Ogbemudia two time governor of Midwest and Bendel state is a six-page text but I've abridged to one page so that I can make the three minutes the topic is one man one vote political and constitutional reforms have been a constant factor in our democratic enterprise I therefore thank the governor of Edo state Comrade Adams Aliyu Oshiomhole for inviting me to speak on this topic one man one vote democracy as government of the people by the people and for the people can only be institutionalised and sustained by the philosophy of one man one vote one man one vote is a robust response to the efforts of the present government to reform our electoral system to an internationally acceptable standard as a member of the board of trustees of my party PDP I can assure you that the foundation of PDP believes in one man one vote option A4 and the open secret ballot system enunciated by the former president Ibrahim Babaginda was a successful democratic experiment I therefore recommend it to our dear people as a way of institutionalising a credible electoral system the acting president Doctor Goodluck Ebele Jonathan in his recent visit to US affirmed that the conduct of a credible election is a cardinal project of the federal government I therefore congratulate the acting president and Edo state governor for their determination and contributions to the enthronement of credible election thank you all and God bless you Independent National Electoral Commission was reconstituted with credible and not partisan people to the acclaim of Nigerians and international community despite a few challenges the new INEC has provided an atmosphere for the conduct of credible elections right from the review of the voters' register to the presidential election which took place last Saturday sadly some misguided elements do not share in the spirit of our democratic achievement they formed into groups of miscreants and struck with deadly and destructive force in some parts of the country they killed and maimed innocent citizens they set ablaze business premises private homes and even places of worship in some cases they showed utter disrespect to all forms of authority including our most revered traditional institutions they systematically targeted population groups they singled out and harassed nationalistic politician they intimidated travellers the mobs also targeted government offices and facilities especially those of INEC they waylaid vulnerable youth corps members even though we all know that these young and innocent Nigerians are guests within our communities and are agents of public good and national unity we're shocked by this horrific act which strike at the heart of our nation these disturbances are more than mere political protest clearly they aim to frustrate the remaining election this is not acceptable if anything at all this acts of mayhem are sad reminders of the events which plunged our country to third month of an unfortunate civil war as a nation we are yet to come to terms with the level of human suffering destruction and displacement including that of our children to far away country occasioned by those dark days in recent years we have also witnessed other acts of intolerance violence and destruction of human life perpetrated by unpatriotic elements for no justifiable reason indeed the nation still bears some of the scars of other similar events like the aftermath on the June twelve nineteen ninety three elections that brought our polity to the brink it is inconceivable therefore that there are some in our midst who seek to reenact a stalemate in the political process my fellow countrymen and women enough is enough democracy is about the rule of law is that its steady that in recent years our judiciary has demonstrated great courage fortitude and independence in the discharge of its duties there are therefore no grievances that our laws and court cannot address I've been in touch with all state governors and relevant security agencies I've consulted with traditional religious and political leaders who are also very disturbed by this trend of events as president it is my solemn duty to defend the constitution of this country that includes the obligations to protect the life and property of every Nigerian wherever they choose to live I will defend the right of all citizens to freely express their democratic choice anywhere in this country to enjoy every freedom and opportunity that this country can offer without let or hindrance I assure all Nigerians that I will do so with all powers at my disposal as president commander in chief I have ordered the deployment of security personnel to troubled parts of the country I have also directed the reinforcement of security in all parts of the country I've authorised our security services to deal with all acts of violence against our fellow citizens decisively in view of the condemnable attack on our gallant youth corps members I have directed all state governors to take personal responsibility for their security and safety in the states where they serve I've directed that the perpetrators of this dastardly act of violence and all those who seek to continue to breach the peace and stability of this nation must be fished out and need to face the full weight of the law in this regard a judicial commission of enquiry will be constituted to look into the immediate and remote causes of this recent tide of unrest I urge all Nigerians to remain law-abiding I appeal to parents to take full charge of their wards we must not allow anybody to use innocent youths as cannon fodder for the ambition of a few let us preserve the sanctity of the life and future of all our children on behalf of all Nigerians I express heartfelt condolences for the victims of this violence and lament the loss of life destruction of means of livelihood the burning of homes and places of worship I appeal to all members of the political class leaders of thought to traditional rulers to continue to put our national interest first at this critical time particularly I call on our religious leaders not to use the sacredness of our places of worship to promote messages that could lead to hate disharmony and disaffection rather we must all at this time join hands and support INEC in ensuring a successful conclusion of the commendable work which it started I appeal to all communities around the country to show restraint in the face of provocation I urge all Nigerians to remain steadfast in prayers for peace and tranquillity in our country I assure you all that calm is being restored in troubled parts of the country and that the elections scheduled for next Tuesday will go on as planned all Nigerians should therefore go about their businesses without fear and exercise their franchise on April twenty six to vote for candidates of their choice the next round of election to those who sow the seed of discord I say you may hurt and bring grief to some innocent families momentarily but you will never succeed in stopping our transformational journey a journey that will lead this country by the grace of God to emerge stronger more prosperous and more united dear brothers and sisters let us continue to build a nation in which we all live in peace a nation where the bonds of our common aspirations and goals will spur and reenergise our resolve to work greatly  as a nation where our children from north and south east and west will grow with hope and live together as brothers sisters and friends let us always remember that we are all part of a shared destiny I thank you all God bless Nigeria and thanks for joining us right about this time good people of a great nation my name is Gbenga Aruleba and it's my pleasure to most warmly welcome you to our programme Nigeria where we put the searchlight on topical issues in the polity hope you had a fulfiled erm salah holiday and I hope it's not too late yet to say barka de salah at least in arrears we are already in a work mode and so as my people would say when it's time for work you work today we are going back to the controversy over the proposed amendments to the electoral act twenty ten it's instructive to provide some background here the electoral act twenty ten was signed into law on August nineteen twenty ten by President Goodluck Jonathan after the two chambers of the national assembly had passed their harmonised version of the bill it's also instructive to know that even when the electoral law had not been operationalised certain innovative provisions in the law gave immediate hope of a better electoral regime better managed and better supervised in particular the new law contained provisions seen as bold attempts to deepen internal democracy in the political parties an apparent lesson learned from the unwholesome actions of the political parties in the countdown to the twenty to the two thousand and seven general elections worthy of mention here is the removal of the initial provision in the two thousand and six electoral act which allowed political parties to substitute candidates by adducing cogent and verifiable reasons for doing so which the parties particularly the People's Democratic Party never obeyed anyway as exemplified in the cases of Rotimi Amaechi and Senator Ifeanyi Araraume new law under -s the two twenty ten electoral act  that clause was removed and once a candidate emerged through the process outlined in section eighty seven of the new act section thirty three makes it completely impossible for the party to withdraw or substitute such candidates the only exceptions to this however are if the candidate on his own volition wrote to INEC to withdraw his nomination or where the candidate dies before election section eighty seven of the new electoral act is perhaps the most progressive it outlined a rigorous process of direct or indirect congresses through which a candidate can only emerge and by this undemocratic conducts of the past such as impositions consensus anointment and coronations of candidates became outlawed in signing the acts President Jonathan had observed and let me quote him here directly although serious concerns have been raised regarding some of the se- erm sections and their capa- erm capacity to constitute our inspiration for expanding democratic space I am driven by the belief that the promise of those processes has greater potential and options to broaden and advance our march to democratic freedom rather than undermine it unquote now it appear that the president's declaration will be put to test even before the ink dried on the paper less than four months and without the benefit of testing this new law erm practically two efforts have been launched to tinker with the law and both attempts have raised serious concerns whether truly our leaders actually mean it when they say they are committed to deepen democracy first effort to amend the electoral act was from the executive which proposed some new clauses and the deleting of some an act which political observers saw as an attempt to whittle down the effect of section eighty seven of the act on the procedure for the emergence of candidates apparently being sensitive to the mood of the public the senate promptly reject that proposal without any debate soon after another effort this time around sponsored and coordinated by some key members of the national assembly began the current proposed amendment basically aim at making every member of the national assembly an automatic member of the national executive committee of his or her political party is an elaborate proposal to again amend section eighty seven of the act the main arguments of the lawmakers has been that they want to deepen internal democracy in these parties by reducing the effect of power blocks so far preponderance of public opinion seems to run against these proposed amendments even as the lawmakers appear bent on achieving their plot on Focus Nigeria this morning we are continuing with our mini public hearing on this issue we try and make the phone work so that you can call us we also welcome your comments through our email address the email address will be displayed appropriately I think it's comments and ? focus dot com but quickly let's tell you some developments in the polity erm Ekiti is where it is happening latest report has it that Ekiti is already on fire as PDP and ACN members clash the new Action C- and erm the new Action Congress of Nigeria led governor test his might against the PDP  which has just been swept out of power is over the recent dissolution of the executives of the sixteen local government councils in the state by Governor Kayode Fayemi and a gradual but bold attempt to dismantle the legacies of what has been known as the legal government and redress some of the illegalities that were given the stamp of legality then and in saying this one needs to go back a little bit in history the composition of the state independent electoral commission that conducted the local government elections which brought in the Segun Oni men                  that were dislodged two weeks ago was a legal and judicial issue the members who appealed by the former governor in complete disregard for equity at the balance of power that existed at that time their screening was done only by the PDP members of the house and so here we are talking of a foundation that was built on absolute illegality and since there's a new government it was only expected that all those issues will be revisited erm on Monday caretaker committees were also announced for the councils which is the current course of the face-off with the PDP which has called on the the post council officials to resume at their duty posts this morning and that is what has led to the report of violence that we are hearing now from Ekiti erm the PDP made this call when governor Alao-Akala dissolved local government elected under former governor Ladoja in Oyo state no he didn't so that call is an ? and should attract sanction but then the police in Ekiti said they are ready to rise up to the occa- let's hope that the lawful authority of the day will be allowed to exercise his mandate without let or interest erm hindrance ultimately and in spite of motions that are being sponsored everywhere the Ekiti state governor will decide how the councils are erm administered within the confines of the constitution erm constitutional requirement that the system of administration at the local government must be democratic local governments and how they are administered are state issues and so cannot be different in the case of Ekiti the Supreme Court said so long ago and ultimately that's what will happen in Ekiti because all the noise will soon die down okay let's apply the brakes here play some beats and when we come back it will be time for our discussion because all my guests are seated in the studio we have tested our height and erm I used to be slightly taller than him but now that he is governor he has gained a few meters erm your Excellency my dear good people of Edo state I come here with a lot of joy because we all ought to be proud to be associated with the struggle of our nation to establish a free fair and democratic society we're all aware that within and outside Nigeria we remain a nation of very discontented people even many of those who hold public office don't feel proud to be associated with our country because like our industries we're severely underperforming democracy was not meant to solve our problems democracy was not meant to build infrastructure for us democracy was not here to just offer us bread and butter if this were the tangible things we wanted we probably will appreciate that we prob- we would have been better off under a dictatorship we've chosen the path of democracy because as Churchill said democracy is not the best form of government it is actually the worst form of government except for others the central and cardinal principle of democracy is freedom freedom to be what we want to be and this freedom in a democratic environment is exercised fundamentally by the symbolic possession of a ballot paper anything that tampers with or desecrates or challenges or disenfranchises a citizen is antithetical to democracy I'm here therefore to support this initiative because without free and fair elections without the ability of ordinary citizens believing that their voices count we can have what may look like the best form of government in terms of infrastructure but the only way we can measure the sense of our self-collect our collective selves' worth is if we internalise the principles of democracy and if we have the right to assert our will through a vote and be sure that we're doing this without intimidation or fear I just came back from Yola where I'm sure many of you will be surprised to hear I was invited by an Islamic organisation to chair a one-day discussion about electoral reforms and one of the points I tried to drive home is the need for us to put behind us all the instruments that the oppressors of yesterdays have used against us whether they be religion whether they be ethnicity whether they be region whether they be power whether they be wealth I tried to make it clear that in this country we don't have a Muslim vote we don't have a northern vote we don't have a Niger Delta vote we have only one central vote our hopes our aspirations must therefore be the same so I commend my friend and my brother comrade Adams Oshiomhole for this initiative that is non-partisan but most importantly is meant to be a landmark and a rallying point for all of us and I encourage all of us as citizens and pray that we will come to a point in which we will be able to cast our vote not because the bishop said so not because the imam said so not because the general said so not because the traditional ruler said so not because a moneyed man or a propertied man says so but we'll be able to cast our vote freely because that is what our belief is along with that will come responsibilities but let us once again commit ourselves to the principles of democracy finally I want to appeal to all of us we are on this road to democracy it is a difficult road but it is a road that we must stay on and resist the temptation of believing that any other institution other than democracy can solve our problem even if for nothing else else let us imbibe the principle that the solution to a bad election is another election let us commit ourselves to the principle that the solution to a bad governor or a bad president is a new president or a new governor let us therefore commit our commitment and our endeavour and our nation to the everlasting protection of Almighty God and I pray that as all of us assert our right we will subsequently develop the prop- appropriate mechanism not only to defend our votes but that those who govern us will come to appreciate that we did not vote for them to enjoy on our behalf we did not vote for them just to enjoy just themselves and their friends and their families but we voted for a better life let us pray that within our own lifetime Nigeria will be a better country and let us pray that our journey on this road of democracy will remain uninterrupted come rain come sunshine may God bless the pe- good people of Edo state and may God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria long live our country long live democracy and long live one man long live one woman long live one young person one vote thank you very much and God bless you all one man one woman one boy one female your Excellency the Governor of Edo state the representative of this the President of the Federal Repub- Republic of Nigeria the Governor of Bayelsa state the former president of Nigeria here present your Excellences may I stand on the other established protocol today is a landmark in the history of this nation the Academic Staff Union of universities is here to identify with this noble and novel programme of Edo state we are not surprised that it is starting in Edo state because we realise that the people of Edo state stood solidly behind the governor to ensure that their vote counted and that is why today he haven't worn the shoes knows where it pinches and understands the essence of one man one vote we have talked about one man one vote that is the part of a process 
and the person takes the turn or you know using quoting you know quoting some of the you know past erm discussions that they wanted to react to you know and they now react and then I have this sequence from one of the you know erm threads you know where somebody makes a general comment then another one co- I mean follows you know with a quote you know and you know on and on like that you if you look at this you find that it's not you know it's not I couldn't ha- it's it's it's very difficult for me to reproduce the discussion you know the length of the discussion so this is the best I can do to try to describe what happens somebody makes a comment another person gives a quote and then you know and the person that he quotes he or she quotes I mean his erm he is or erm expressions reacted and so on and so forth until you know but the major ways they try to take care of this non-sequentiality was to either address the person they wanted to to speak directly or they quote what the previous I mean somebody has said previously in order to be sure that this is the person erm you know actually hoping to talk next so erm we didn't have much of what erm those who have worked on on turn-taking describe as erm as erm the current speaker selecting the next speaker it's it wasn't too I mean there there were not too many instances of that there were more instances of the current speaker just self-selecting you know that's I mean people just come in when they feel like you know and then they go on like that but in spite of all these there was still a kind of erm interactional coherence you're still able to put everything together and people at the end of the day were still able to follow the trend of of discussion so that is  I mean that's on the the turn-taking then now coming to another aspect you know a discourse aspect which I I interactional aspect which I looked at that is language and identity in the diaspora this this appears to be one very important aspect of the study you know and then my findings especially from through erm from erm the Nigerian village square was that Nigerians in the diaspora construct their identities as the voice for the oppressed at home I mean those who are based at home they kind of feel the kind of oppression that they go through even though here right here in the diaspora they they don't feel I mean they they are not directly subjected to that but from their discussion you could see that they I mean they they they had what I mean this empathy for Nigerians at home and whenever they had the opportunity to speak on their behalf they did so and erm if you look at the first erm two erm state I mean two erm erm extracts that I have there if only it were possible to silence Nigerians abroad like they always do to those at home I'm sure by now they would have turned our country into a barren deser- desert you know thi- this this is to show that they they felt people at home were being silenced but they have the privilege to speak you know and as people have privilege to speak and they could now use this medium you know to express themselves then another one hello my villagers can I plead on behalf of madam information on her comment towards we diasporans one thing for sure is this whether we accept it or not that country must change and the transformation must come from Nigerians in the diaspora you know I mean this discussion came up after erm a statement made by the current Minister for information erm who who who said that Nigerians abroad were you know dishonourable because they don't speak well about the nation and then many of them took this you know erm serious and they they decided to discuss it and here you have you know a forum dedicated to this kind of discussion and erm you know that's that's that's the kind of thing you hear I mean or you read from Nigerians discussing erm such I mean issues on their feelings you know about situation at home then erm another aspect of the finding is the use of culture specific lexis verbal genres erm code switching and Nigerian pidgin as deliberate erm erm attempts to construct their identities as Nigerians you know they they they there's this I mean they generally tend to use some aspects of erm Nigerianisms as some people call it you know so I mean the way  a typical Nigerian will talk you know i- it's the way they you know discuss on this forum and these are some of the I mean there are two extracts oya  abeg delete or log that yamayama take jo quickly in the interest of peace and progress you know this is pidgin for those who are familiar with pidgin you know English and then you know pidgin then erm you know it's a kind of interspersed with some Nigerian language expressions like oya oya is Yoruba okay and then  jo please means please and then yamayama is  is just erm kind of reduplication meaning rubbish or you know that kind of thing you know and then abeg meaning I beg you you know abeg no let these idiots give you blood pressure I swear this was my exact reaction just could not put it to words see you never curse them well kilode gan self in fact multiply all your epe by one million you know this kilode gan is Yoruba what what exactly is the matter  and then epe is curse you know to to put a curse on someone and then I mean you find this kind of expressions quite you know common in Nigerian threads then erm flaming I also did a a study on flaming you know the use of uninhibited erm expressions you know impolite expressions on other members directed towards other members of the forum or outsiders and erm my findings were that flaming occurred more in the context of political topics and the interpretation I gave this is that Nigeria has been struggling to get it right politically and a lot of Nigerians just saw I mean the internet as a means of expressing themselves freely about the political situation in Nigeria and erm they they really did their best to to express themselves you know especially on political topics of course there were flaming expressions in other you know threads but they were not as common as those of erm erm of erm on based on politics and erm of erm like I said earlier participants frequently switched from the Nig- to the Nigerian pidgin any of this and or any of the indigenous languages when expressing flaming behaviour it it was quite common for them to use abusive forms in the local languages or the pidgin English rather than English and I think the the the feeling is that it's they i- they are better expressed you know in these languages than in English I also found out that name calling and personality attacks were predominant you know in the in the flaming forms I mean they used you know they they chose to call people names and then try to deride their intelligence you know for instance I I will show some you know comments that erm express this kinds of personality attacks you know direct attack on the persons okay these are some of the as for the idiot called general IBB I just tighten igno- ignolist screw okay IBB was I mean is a former ruler of Nigeria and then daft people they got the wrong word for rebranding okay erm again referring this was referring to the people in government you know of recent the people in government have started talking about rebranding of Nigeria and then Nigerians in the diaspora felt this must be a joke because they're there's really nothing to rebrand that the people in government should rebrand themselves before they now talk about Nigerians rebranding so I mean these are some of the comments and erm the comment number seven they don't even need to inform anybody no one should notice if it's strike or power failure no difference so good riddance PHCN many people are no aware of your existence to hell you know and this this is a thread on erm the PHCN that is the electricity generating company for Nigeria you know they were planning at a point in time they were planning to go on strike and erm this news came out and then given the backgrounds that people know what happens that these people hardly generate any electricity you hardly find you know almost every Nigerian now has an electricity generating plant you know so people generate their their their electricity and so when the company now says they want to go on strike this this the way people feel that you don't even need to tell us because even before we we don't know I mean we we have never felt your presence so it's a go on strike and you can as well go forever you know we will still survive you know without you and erm then the use of indigenous languages you know to to express flaming behaviour I mean this the first one number eight says this is an insult on Igbo heritage just in case you don't realise why do I bother that's that's all you have even down here anuofia anuofia means erm bush meat I hope I got it right yeah and it's a kind of it's an Igbo expression you know it's it's it's a it's a kind of abuse  bush meat is a kind of game you know animal you know from the bush you know it's a what idiot okay yeah I mean that's that's that would be erm erm how do I put it now it's it's real translation but the direct translation is bush meat yeah then olodo African-American is the same thing as African is the same thing as African is that what they told you in Spain I guess this person maybe commented from  the previous you know erm discussant commented from somewhere in Spain and then this comment came afterwards olodo in Yoruba means dullard a dullard okay so these are some of the erm ways they flame one another and erm again something on the PHCN which is a bit lengthy but this this this conveys somebody's feelings about the staff of PHCN and I think it's it's it's just a way of letting out their you know feel- I mean people's way of letting out their feelings about the socio- economic political situation in in Nigeria I mean it's lengthy like I said it's you know that going by what we have here that these are highly educated people who I mean I mean the kind of construction the kind of English used and all those things but in some other instances they switch to the language of the commoners which is pidgin you know mixed with some erm Nigerian you know erm language expressions then on SMS I I did a spe- I mean a a a a I mean quite a number of studies on SMS and these are some of the findings erm that SMS can be used to enhance rhetorical competence in written discourse I know a lot of people have their reservations about SMS because they feel it affects the competence of users because sometimes some of the erm lingo that people use in SMS get into their written you know expressions but I I I my observation is that it's possible that SMS can be used to help the people I will show this later and erm the the teachers just have to play the role of those who will create the awareness of context style and purpose so that the more they make the students to be aware of this the more likely that the students will not I mean will be will will will be conscious of the different contexts in which they can use different kinds of you know and linguistic forms and erm I also observed that SMS can be a good repository erm for teaching sorry for that mistake for teaching some basic aspects of language like spelling word order word boundary word formation and I'll I'll come to that illustration on some SMS I mean this is one SMS because you are humble and hate to fumble you'll not tumble nor grumble your enemies will mumble and double trouble because your time to bubble because it's your time to bubble I I feel this this has some kind of rhyme you know and erm th- this could actually you know people using SMS were actually constructing you know using some literary devices without being aware of it and erm this could be used to teach rhyme for instance I mean the the ending you can see the ending of each of the words  humble fumble stumble grumble mumble double trouble bubble you know and erm and I'm not too sure that those who constructed this actually knew that this was what they were doing and then again another one this new morn God we edify identify justify modify beautify purify gratify magnify dignify satisfy and glorify you you know this this are typical SMS that people send around in Nigeria and erm the the the the the they have I mean the the the teachers can you really use this to create this awareness in in students then again another one life is like a piano white keys are happy moments and black keys are sad moments but remember both keys are played together and blah blah blah we can meet at two we'll wait you know la- like the first one erm this is erm a simile you know a a comparison between life and piano and erm we have a lot of erm text messages in this form then the the number fourteen we can meet at two we'll wait for you at the bus stop we can go to the you know here what I see here is that there are some instances in which the word boundary is not very clear you know and everything is just written together and erm for language I mean for erm ESL learners this this may be good I mean especially those at the early stage I mean for them to be able to identify what the word boundaries are so that yes they can do this in SMS but they will not be able to do it in the normal writing you know now normal in quote then erm well still talking about the innovation now on innovation and and language change that SMS draws on social and cultural symbols to create humour affection and pray- prayer and critiques of the government and its agents okay again I'll show some erm text messages that that erm that erm you know I erm I mean are examples of this then metaphor hyperbole pun symbolisms are used you know and erm these are used to I mean to convey a text messages in the Nigerian sociocultural context only Nigerians will understand what this mean again I'll show some examples an SMS has the potential of becoming an instrument for active agitation for social change again I will I'll show some but let me give a background to this there was a time Nigerians felt that the erm charges that erm service providers erm that the the the charges of p- service providers we-  I mean was too high and they were looking for a way to protest and they use the same instrument you know the SMS you know through mobile phones to protest against erm this high tariffs what Nigerians did then was just to I mean a group of people you know who claim to be representing the interest of mobile users in Nigeria sent a text message round around to all mobile phone users that on a particular day they should all switch off their phones and then for the whole day of a particular period of time that this will end up you know the the service providers will lose a lot of money and then they could now reconsider this issue of high tariffs that by the time Nigerians do this regularly you know for a period of time then maybe the the the service providers will reduce their their tariff charges and this actually worked they did it only once and then the next I mean in the next few months the the the the providers started reviewing their charges and now erm to a large extent I think the use of a mobile phone is is is is relatively you know erm affordable for I mean a good number of Nigerians so erm so I'll just give some examples erm fifteen here says there are three visitors waiting at the door they have knocked and there was no response they are joy peace and love please open the door for them I have sent them to stay with you tonight this is this is creative for me and erm I think erm I received this some I think that was some time in two thousand and four and erm the first thought that came to my mind you know when you when I read up to a point well then I thought some people were actually waiting outside for me up to a point but when I finished reading then I'd realised that it wasn't really it was just a kind of humour and then you know just erm a play with language   or what have you and then the pastor must hear this yesterday you were with peace today again I saw you going out with favour it's an open secret you to brethren that joy is your regular companion I think these are the kind of things you find among Christians you know to construct their sentiments and about their Christian beliefs and all those talk and then here we have more examples may God give you a rainbow for every storm a ps- smile for every fear a blessing for every trial a sweet song for every sigh and an answer for every prayer again this are in the context this are SMS that you find in the context of Christian circles you know people who but you find some of them like eighteen  here is I mean is is is a plays on the some of the erm background knowledge of Nigerians you know on the use of SMS there's something we called a flash which well in some places they call beeping you know I I I d- I it's it's I think it's it's a more common or popular culture in Africa I'm not sure it's I I don't know if it's done here in Europe you know that you flash somebody what does it mean to flash you just called a person wait for the phone to ring for a period of time then cut it before the person picks it and then you somehow it sends some message to the person that you are trying to communicate something now people use this flashing of erm that's what it's popularly called in Nigeria but in some other places they call it beeping you know it's the people use it to convey different kind of messages like people don't have enough money in th- in in I mean enough credit on their phone who actually flash others and then those people would now call them and erm people could actually also agree to flash when I get there when you get there just flash me so that I will know that you are already there okay then I will start coming and things like that you know so but people have different dispositions to flashing and erm it depends on the circle one belongs to but I think in Nigeria it's a very common erm culture you know with erm associated with the use of mobile phones alright erm let me start by erm formally expressing my appreciation for being here erm being part of this sharing team of erm researchers on Nigerian English in particular and erm my special thanks also to professor Gut who didn't have to know me but erm trusted in in my work and in me to bring me here so I feel good being in Germany being in your company so God bless you for giving me the opportunity I'm just going to share my thoughts part of my thoughts on erm Nigerian English and erm I didn't prepare to present my PhD work but this part is like erm a very important engine in my work so that if I'm successful with this I think I've done well if I'm not successful oh then I have to begin again research is for me a struggle that would not end so the study proposes a framework for formalising the phonology of Nigerian English for pedagogic purposes it is part of the ongoing codification of Nigerian English much of which has concerned itself with efforts to describe Nigerian English and its characteristic properties it is shown that this variety of English is non-monolithic but characterised by a very complex range of varieties and long varied axis including socio-educational ethnolinguistic and regional dimensions among others each comprising its own subvarieties the existence of these multiple varieties is a ground for the needed formalisation other reason another reason is the confusion it has occasioned for the national pedagogic enterprise within which it is yet to be shown  what norms should be pursued also since the sociolinguistic freedom of national Englishes in the Outer Circle is established formalising a model is deemed a sociocultural imperative it is also part of a worthy expression of a Nigerian nationhood to present a standard s- a standard that is suitable for the exigencies of modern times there is an important step in addressing these native codification and coding standardisation and developing a framework for establishing the norms of the phonology as an early part of this concern the framework leans on the variables of social acceptance and international intelligibility and proposes six parameters borrowing the optimality metaphor the parameters are around providing for dominance and viability this operation therefore evaluates attested phonological materials and selects preferred elements of the grammar as candidates for the normative inventory now I'm not going to bug you with erm these background information I'm glad that the earlier presentation by professor Gut and her group has provided much of that so erm I thought that I wasn- I was going to spare you that erm excuse me please erm in the handout there is a the de- the mean the the the information is fuller and we have just limited copies and I understand that more copies may be made later so much of some erm much of the things that erm erm may not say here may be found in the handout so in addition to the information already given there are some others which we'll note just in passing just because they are important in the considerations that affect the framework one is that this English belongs to the Outer Circle of English going by the model of erm Englishes erm suggested by Braj Kachru is an established canon it is  shown erm here and there the details may be found in the in the handout there are clines of varieties a few classificatory erm varia- erm variables have been erm agreed upon and erm three of them are here ethnic language substrate erm level of educational attainment degree of linguistic difference from the exoglossic norm at least on the basis of these assumptions that our pedagogic framework is being suggested now in the view of the present study it is on the part of realism to assume that all these varieties are addressed in the classifications outlined in the researches erm that we may find in those erm references and details without exception they constitute Nigerian English hence part of the totality of the socioling- sociocultural system which is Nigerian following research efforts the concern for the educated cline reveals at least three varieties which are identified to include the speech of the less educated and the highly educated at the extremes of the cline or the mother tongue based varieties and the varieties thought indistinguishable from British based world standards now here we come to our main business the framework is in pursuit of the development of the endonormative model which has purportedly evolved through natural sociolinguistic processes but requires precise description definition and formalisation for pedagogic purposes in essence it should be capable of indicating which sounds and prosodies in which sounds and prosodies constitute part of the normative inventory that teaching and learning should target as well as other properties which may more adequately characterise a pedagogic model the framework defines six parameters for identifying elements of phonology which may participate in the normative inventory the parameters are ranked but not inviolable borrowing the optimality notion metaphorically the parameters are as follows international acceptance defined as close approximation to the more international norms contrastiveness defined as phonological distinctiveness frequency defined as overall high rate of occurrence disambiguity defined as preference for property or properties that diminish ambiguity or miscommunication or both phonetic simplicity defined as preference for features which seem or seems physiologically more plausible and pedagogic convenience defined as preference for features which advise for silence in teaching and learning the parameters are ranked in the order shown above one to six with in-built flexibility or viability in optimality terms while one addresses the need to understand and be understood by other competent speakers in the world and so remain relevant in the global community and the fact that the average Nigerian still looks up to the British model even when they are not able to reproduce the British type pronunciation two permits those properties whose phonological status remains crucial to international intelligibility even when learning them appears onerous three incorporates those properties which may suggest deviance relatively but be a distinguishable Nigerian mark and have higher rate of occurrence while the latter is being considered ambiguity should be kept to the barest minimum which is the point in four five is related to six in that what is physiologically more plausible may be relatively easier to learn but may not be preferred over and above four hence the ranking for instance in other words the segment or feature contrast existent int- in international norms may be maintained wherever possible otherwise defia- deviant forms with higher frequency of occurrence may be selected the occurrence of ambiguity may be permitted if any resultant homophony does not crucially diminish international acceptance accordingly wherever the phonological segments or features of international English appear real to the intuition of the average Nigerian educa- the average educated Nigerian speaker the relevant segments or features my be retained even where its phonetic realisation has perceivable Nigerianess as we conceive it then parameters are complementary providing a thorough guide towards the development of a Nigerian standard English a model of education this English might then be different not deviant from British English or RP American English Indian English or indeed any other in many respects but internationally intelligible where does whatever signs these predictions may based on the expanded parameters it needs be authenticated in the framework that is being proposed the proposed application of the framework as a tool to isolate those preferred candidates both of sounds and prosodies one part and group them as constituents of the Inner Circle norms what remains is not discarded but may pass through the frame in a second application  these unauthorised this time qualified candidates constitute an Outer Circle inventory an alternative is to permit all others are regarded as non-standard patterns of Nigerian English in other words the proposed schema is capable of sifting the grammar to isolate standard elements in ranks of preference based on the framework it predicts that input units consist of all elements of a family of units that may occur in the phonological including phonetic inventory and output elements are representatives of classes of such items preferred in the grammar in other words input materials are considered as members of phonological space defined as all range of possible realisations of segments within a lexical content for instance the segment options overranks specifies therein the output materials didn't constit- consist of all materials in the competition that emerge as optimum or preferred units while the preferred output in the competition may belong to the Inner Circle the next of them belong to the Outer Circle others which still constituent-formed elements of the grammar may belong to a developing circle understood a- so may belong to a developmental circle understood in the grammar as non-standard forms no element of the grammar may be thought inconsequential or be discarded particularly in view of the fact what may lie outside the normative inventory may bear sociolinguistic information indicate directions of future language change or bear trace of that ? among others now in this consideration a two-way standard emerges following the expanded parameters and the application of the schema namely an inner standard and an outer standard while the inner standard may be less distinguishable from the more international norms the outer standard may be more distinguishable pedagogic engagements may- may aim at the inner standard always but permit the outer standard which in this consideration may bear those regional flavours of the educated speech that may not significantly diminish international intelligibility these two-way standard emerging from the application of the framework reflects pluricentricity in Nigerian English that is a binormative or two-centre standard while the inner standard may retain highest highest prestige and remain pragmatically more viable in international socio-economic considerations these outcome provides further clarity to researchers' consensus that the normative varieties are the products of varying intensity and quality of  exposure to world to world standard of English or that or that variety which is closer to standard British English and exhibits less mother tongue transfers in particular if it is recognised that the direction of advancement and proficiency is always towards the more globally viable standards and same is what teaching and learning hope to achieve then the inner standard here is the preferred standard it also justifies the fact that Nigerian English is non-monolithic by showing recognition for core centres and standards furthermore proposing circles for the Nigerian English is one way in which this recognition can be accounted for as a sociolinguistic realism these approaching is outcome promise a compromise between the extreme views of those who hope for exoglossic norms and those who hope for endoglossic norms and resolves the issue of regional and tribal distinctions while yet subsuming educational attainment special training or cultivation no matter how subtle our borrowing metaphorically the optimality theory is in respect to the following parallels first the parameters parallel constrains and as constraints are ranked with respect to one another so are the parameters international acceptance dominates contras- constructiveness which dominates frequency and all that  and all that as we can show abbreviated in this manner where IC stands for international I mean IAC stands for international acceptance and then contris for contrastiveness the freq is for frequency disam is for disambiguity and p is for erm phonolo- erm phonetic simplicity and pc is for erm pedagogic erm simplicity or convenience the parameters may be interpreted in the OT convention as negative statements namely no international acceptance so non-international acceptance is prohibited no con- incontrastiveness is prohibited infrequency is profi- prohibited ambiguity is prohibited phonetics co- phonetic complec- complexity is prohibited pedagogic difficulty is prohibited the parameters are ranked but violable they evaluate the input candidates and constitute one component the input constitutes another compin- another component and elements of this component are all attested forms within lexical context in the cline not underlying forms instead recent forms are provided which may mark clues to orthogr- orthographic spelling if required dispensing with underlying forms appears to have two main advantages for new Englishes the first is that we avoid estimating new Englishes in terms of any known other national model and secondly we account for na- national languages as natural languages as properties of cultures and as sociolinguistic phenomena in view of the latter any attested elemen- elements that are not preferred are not discarded but are treated as members of the non-standard cline belonging to the developmental circle thereby preserving them as linguistic species the other component is the output it consists only of forms which may be considered optimal or preferred the preference subsumes tendencies remotely the grammar may therefore be called preference or operational grammar poc if christening is thought necessary poc is summarised below it is also possible to illustrate the operation using a tableau as in conventional OT this is the framework the input consists of attested forms then erm the machine check check is the parameters which isolate or evaluate the the candidates for prefe- for pre- for for preference then the output is just preferred forms it can also be erm shown and erm the more erm conventional optimality in this way erm however where we would normally have erm well erm yes where you have go there you would normally have erm an underlying form which erm will become the yardstick for measuring faithfulness so by erm avoiding the use of underlying forms we achieve as I had noted earlier the fact that we don't have a model to bench any erm any variety of any national variety of English on- that use attested forms only so some concluding notes as shown above it is in perspective to assume that all varieties of English in Nigeria are Nigerian constituting part of the sociocultural resources of the nation it is also clearly the fact that all varieties constitute a continuum involving identifiable but non discrete core centres it is equally clear from all the research efforts so far that the Nigerian standards has a Nigerian standard has emerged it is a level standard arising from natural sociolinguistic processes within this educat- within this educated cline at least three varieties are identified to include the speech of the less educated and the highly educated at the extremes or the mother tongue based varieties and the varieties indistinguishable from the British based world standards since pedagogic principles require that something must be taught and all varieties may not constitute a model at one and the same time within the same polity it is at least undesirable the question of selection arises and in response to this questions some items have been made none of which specifically pinpoints any tangible elements of the forms they suggest thus Nigerian standard English following erm those information so far seems a hazy reference to the existing educated variants essentially on the question of whether or or some ors  or one of these varieties should be considered normative which English should aim at remains to be addressed erm Jibril and others proposed popular Nigerian English or educated Nigerian English or some po- sophisticated Nigerian English none of which indicates precisely what the phonological elements should consist of or the speci- or the specific means to the normative inventory the obvious fact is that these yet to be formalised variants cannot serve the pedagogic purpose in their present forms if formalisation is not achieved hence the present work the sociolinguistic imperative is therefore to pursue the codification and standardisation of the indigenised codes constructing a framework for the rest erm the references and all that good morning everybody I want to talk about the rhythm of standard Nigerian English the rhythm as we understand it here is the melody of speech erm which results from the emphasis or lack of emphasis that we give to the words and syllables that we use so this study is a continuation of a preliminary investigation that was done in nineteen ninety seven and published in two thousand and three erm into the rhythm of the Nigerian accent of English in that study it was discovered that there are three three main varieties of Nigerian English the non-standard the standard and the sophisticated and this corresponds to the level of education and exposure and the amount of use of the language now all three have common features which include the presence or preponderance of several stressed syllables and the more or less even duration that is to say that the duration do not vary erm to show reduced or full vowels and the the appearance not the real fact that Nigerians seem to stress more syllables and wrong syllables wrong in quotes from the native speaker now there have been several descriptions of Nigerian English the traditional one is the syllable-timed description and this comes from the fact that human languages are divided into stress-timed syllable-timed are erm mora-timed depending on so that has been the most erm well-known description of the rhythm of Nigerian English then Udofot nineteen ninety seven was the first full-scale study of rhythm in Nigerian English and that study identified rhythm that was different not common to all the varieties the non-standard varieties seem to agree to the erm syllable-timing timing description but the standard and the sophisticated Nigerian English was close to British English because the control in that study was a British was slightly different in the sense that erm there was something else that was noticed that words and syllables did not erm the break did not come at the stressed point but at the word boundary now other people have described the rhythm of standard Nigerian English like Gut two thousand and two erm measured the vocalic intervals and came up with the idea that Nigerian English sounded like Singaporean English in rhythm erm with regard to the vocalic intervals then Udofot nineteen ninety three found out that the syllable timing described the non-standard but that the standard and the sophisticated which is almost like British English required more investigation so this study erm set out to study standard Nigerian English that is the one that almost every educated Nigerian speaks the sophisticated one is not very well accepted it sounds affected and people describe such people as people who have been to and they're trying to mimic the British or the American so standard Nigerian English in this case is the speech of university men and women those who have had a univ- erm university education and a degree erm from the Master's degree so the subjects were those people who have a degree first degree Masters and PhD so in this case our objective was to look at the speech of these people those educated Nigerians that could represent Nigerian English and also to acoustically analyse both the spontaneous and read speech of these people and to ascertain the nature of rhythm and the idea was to look at the alternation of strong and weak syllables the- preliminary study used the metrical theory so we decided in this study to continue with the metrical metrical theory and also to do some acoustic analysis syllable duration and also look at the tone and pitch accent and see how they contribute to rhythm the basic assumption of this study is that the speaker of Nigerian English does not really represent accent or stress in terms of pitch accent of Germanic languages but in word tone patterns and each such pattern sounds like a pitch accent to English or native speakers' ears so that compound words like what the British will say anyone lal- landlord you know have word boundary lowering and the break between any and one so that the Nigerian seems to be saying landlord anyone erm not what a native speaker would say anyone or landlord and the hypothesis of this study is that what is responsible for this is tone the Nigerian languages operate tone on every syllable or word causing the native speaker to interpret the pattern as if every syllable is stressed and at this erm the pitch tends to lower at word boundaries therefore appearing to stress the wrong syllable and that tone rather than stress affects the rhythm of standard Nigerian English the sample consisted of twenty Nigerians of various ethnolinguistic backgrounds who have university degrees and the control was an English an Eng- an English born and bred in England she was also educated in England but she's married to a Nigerian and has lived in Nigeria for many years now studies I have said that although few Nigerians from literate homes and those who attended good primary and secondary schools speak standard Nigerian English such studies as Jibril Banjo ? Udofot Jowitt have shown that the bulk of the speakers of standard Nigerian English are educated men and women university educated erm people so we use the corpus-based method to collect four sentences from each subject two of those sentences were answers to questions that the subjects were ask and the other two were picked from a read passage we had a series of erm readings and we picked the best and the stress pattern was analyse using Shane's nineteen seventy nine modified version of the metrical theory the sentences were analyse acoustically using Praat speech analysis software  now what the metrical notation erm means is that rhythm is seen as resulting from the alternation of strong and weak syllables s and w are assigned directly to base forms taking into account both syllable structure and morphological information so s strong weak strong weak would characterise the perfect stress timing but in this study and in Shane's version there are ternary structures like strong weak weak or strong strong strong and we did not apply the principle of the rhythmic alternation because if that occurs it is supposed to be applied to maintain the rhythm because we wanted to highlight the rhythm of standard Nigerian English so from our from the full paper we we I got this small table showing the typical stress and tonal patterns of the experimental group erm twenty of them out of the twenty of them eighteen used this pattern that we have here erm for em- the question was what's your mother tongue and the answer was my mother tongue is and the person erm put in the mother tongue so the Nigerian speakers most of them had what you have there strong weak stro- erm weak strong strong weak strong strong like saying my mother tongue is whereas the British Eng- English speaker said my mother tongue is so as we see there Nigerian English has more strong syllables and does not appear to follow the rhythmic alternation evident in the speech of the control and when we put in the tone we notice that the weak syllables and the strong syllables do not really correlate with low and high tones now and the other sentence from the read passage that we took was everyone scolded and trashed everyone else and you can see the pattern there whereas the British speaker did not say everyone scolded and trashed everyone else she rather said everyone scolded and trashed everyone else and that's what we have tried to show with the patterns there so again in the read speech it was evident that Nigerian English has more more strong syllables and the patterns does not follow the rhythmic alternation evident in the speech of the control and the Nigerians' tendency to use tone on every syllable in Ni- is shown here in their English it is transferred to English so when we looked at the syllable durations erm this is just a portion of the larger table erm you could s- you can see that from that table you don't see much difference between full vowel and the and the reduced vowel mother the Nigerian speaker the first one has oh point one four seconds and mu- oh point one three so between the full vowel and the reduced vowel there's not much difference but the control had for mother oh point one seven and then oh point zero so there's some difference then not speaking to anyone not speaking to anyone so if you take speaking speaking this the the full vowel and the reduced vowel the Nigerian speakers don't show much variation oh point two three oh point one eight oh point two four oh point one eight whereas the control had oh point three oh and then oh point two one so for the syllable durations what we noted was that Nigerian English hardly vary which we have noted before to reflect the distinction between stress and unstressed syllables or full and reduced vowels as in mother speaking and there is no significant difference in the durations of full and reduced vowels this goes to confirm Udofot nineteen ninety seven the tables we have seen we calculated the mean duration the standard deviation and the mean deviation the variance and what we saw are the figures given the which does not show the significant difference between full and reduced vowels we also took the pitch contour and the Text Grid erm this is just one of the utterances we used not speaking to anyone that is a typical Nigerian speaker shown there and that is the British speaker and what we noted from the pitch contour and Text Grid is that lowering occurs at the word boundary erm the Nigerian speaker as against the British speaker for instance we saw not speaking to anyone the tonal pattern was for anyone Nigerian the Nigerian speaker said anyone whereas the British speaker said anyone and the pitch contour also shows clearly defined rises and falls in the presen- in this performance of the British speaker if we just go back to it again they are marked whereas the Nigerian speaker seem to speak at more or less the same level downstepped high high downstepped high and high and high and this one was high low low for anyone anyone so the hypothesis for this study was that the Nigerians' tendency to use tone on every syllable in their mother tongue is transferred to English and tone not stress is used on every syllable strong or weak in fact Nigerians do not use stress in their languages so the auditory impression that many have is that all syllables are stressed this confirms our first hypothesis that the Nigerian speaker uses  uses tone on each syllable causing the native s- English speaker to interpret the pattern as if every syllable is stressed our second hypothesis was that standard Nigerian English is different from the native English in terms of stress placement and duration but as shown by the mean deviations the difference is not statistically erm significant in fact a Nigerian who has used lear- who has been sufficiently educated in English can you can hardly differentiate be- except for the tone factor erm that the the person would tend to use tone but for the sophisticated speakers at times is difficult to identify that this is a Nigerian erm except for the standard speakers and the non-standard speakers so the performances of the individual members also shows some divegences which are also not statistically significant the figures showed that some of the- all of them did not spe- use for instance duration erm in the same way some had longer slightly longer slightly shorter but the the tone feature was almost uniform and the fact that Nigerians tend to lower the pitch at word boundaries not stress boundaries accounts for the apparent wrong stress placement so the third hypothesis was that it to- it is tone rather than stress that tends to characterise the rhythm of standard Nigerian English since tone not stress is used by the Nigerian speaker the rhythmic pattern cannot be referred to as stress-timed and in fact many studies including Gut's two thousand and two studies suggest that Nigerian English is not stress-timed the standard and the sophisticated one erm Gut even went further to compare it to Singaporean English and she said it stands between a stress-timed intonation language and a tone language and this confirms earlier descriptions of standard Nigerian English rhythm as not being stress-timed or syllable-timed so the task is to find a nomenclature a description for standard Nigerian English it has been shown that standard Nigerian the accent of English that we call standard in Nigeria has been shown to be different from the performance of a native speaker even though the difference is not statistically significant except with th- regard to tone it is still different and that it is the tone that gives the auditory impression of pitch accent indicating stress to the ears of speakers of Germanic languages is not the same stress feature so erm we have in this study ventured to suggest that perhaps a better description of the rhythm of standard Nigerian English could be tone-timed not stress-timed in fact Udofot nineteen ninety seven in her PhD work has suggested that spoken Nigerian's English sounds like the pulsations of an African drum that it is rhythmic but it doesn't vary in tempo because it's there is drumming the African drum you will hear something like kombokombokomboko bumbumbum bumbumbum bumbum the same more or less the same level of timing but hardly any variations so that it is not adequate to call it stress-timed and that standard Nigerian English is certainly not syllable-timed in fact Udofot two thousand and three study suggested that more investigations should be done about standard Nigerian English rhythm so this is what we have done we have gone through the studies again and then we have now said that we want to modify our earlier descriptions of standard Nigerian English in fact at a point we tried Bolinger's nineteen eighty one full vowel timing and it looked ale- adequate because Nigerian English has a predominance of full vowels but today for this study we suggest that more research be done into the effect of tone on rhythm in Nigerian English and that perhaps a better description is tone-timed not stress-timed thank you thank you very much actually the presentation our presentation is on the Ibibio corpus and this erm the corpus was arrived at from two different erm projects the DAAD-funded project and the speech technology funded project by a non-governmental organisation called outside ECO but briefly I want to erm give an introduction on Ibibio language erm the Ibibio language is a lower-cross subgroup of the new Benue Congo language family it is a tone language and has approximately four million speakers from the last erm census the two thousand and seven census and it's spoken in the south eastern region of Nigeria and unfortunately I don't have the language map  available now erm it consist of erm about three groups the Anaang we have is erm a group we call the Anaang they also speak we can hear them they can hear us we have the Oron people and the Ibibio group broke up from the Efok and the erm erm Cross River and for some time now we've been struggling of about who speaks which Efik says Ibibio originated from Efok and Ibibio says Efok originated from Ibibio and there are several erm documents to show that there is no standard erm at least reached yet now in two thousand and four we there was a erm a project that came of the local language speech technology initiative project actually professor doctor Dafydd Gibbon from Universitaet Bielefeld came and gave a talk in Uyo on speech synthesis and I found interest in that erm topic and I said why not div- erm divert from erm doing your PhD in computer science why not choose an application so I was interested and he sourced for funding erm from outside ECO and we erm profess- erm doctor Roger Tooker and erm Senia erm erm cooperated erm on erm developing synthesisers for minor- minority languages now the goal of the listing is to develop speech synth- systems for local languages it is a consortium that draw members from different language speaking groups as at the moment we have about erm erm some lang- erm synthesisers for some languages which can be accessed or downloaded from the listi dot org site so we have the Ibibio from Nigeria erm Kiswahili a Kenyan language Hindi which is an Indian language and Izi Zulu a South African language so when you see the listi dot org you can download and try this the sample sentences you can try and then test the intelligibility of these erm synthesisers now the funding for the project as I said came from a tripartite DAAD project between two thousand and two and two thousand and six and a one year university industry erm funded project erm by outside ECO and currently we are trying to erm source for funding from the erm STEPB project is a a erm a a a a a collaborative project between erm Nigeria and the World Bank so it's called the Science and Technology Education Post Basic project so Nige- the Nigerian Federal government will get funding from the World Bank and then give it to institutions and we have applied for funding to enable me erm complete my PhD project because I'm trying to insert erm tone currently we have a tone-deaf synthesiser so we want to see how we can include tone into the synthesiser to make it more intelligible now erm there are two s- erm issues the linguistic issues and the resource issues we identified in the erm erm TTS erm project now erm we had the syllable phonotactics that erm which was a major determinant of the unit-base resource the inflectional morphotactics which erm determines for instance whether we wanted to dena- determine whether a a table lookup or rule-based techniques will be more appropriate for handling the vocabulary and the adapt- adaptation of grammatical cons- erm context also we also had erm erm context tonal modifications in associative erm construction where when we have two words like erm ubok which is hand and nganika which is clock erm or wrist erm or or watch then combined together the it simply means the long and short hand of a clock or watch also something like eno anabassi eno meaning erm gift anabassi God when you combine them it gives eno abassi which is erm God's gift normally Eno is somebody's name so we can also use then we also have this sentence erm structure the resource issues erm depends on the development environment in Nigeria and constitutes issues like human resources so currently the DAAD-funded project gave that to erm the MA and PhD erm programme approved by the university senate so we can now more people can now offer M- MA and PhD courses in specialised programmes like erm language documentation and speech technology so actually we since we di- erm didn't have enough manpower so we made it a collaborative project between our university and university of Bielefeld and the university of Cocody in erm Abidjan so the erm programme is on is ongoing and I've enrolled in the PhD programme for speech technology so in my first year I'm gathering literature in Nigeria second year will be abroad let's say in Germany or U K where I will now actually do now the synthesis work so in the for the Ibibio corpus we erm during the preparation and refinements stage erm we had no erm Ibibio corpus i- there's electronic corpus  so we had that erm problem and erm erm challenges so we had to look for corpus erm everywhere and luckily we had a news erm erm media that erm erm we visited and got the corpus some corpus anyway and we also looked for textbooks where we type erm what we had there we also collected stories and fairy tales so at the end we had about four thousand five hundred phrases and then we an expert erm speaker professor Eno Abassi Urua looked through that corpus and then corrected erm the corpus then from there we wrote a script that erm generated erm phonetically balanced sentences that is diphone rich sentences using a Unix script and we also looked at the orthography and the f- erm representation format actually the one the fu- the text we collected from the news room were had the erm accents and orthographic erm forms so we wanted something that could be could help us so we had to erm also write a script to eliminate those accents and then convert the erm text to SAMPA equivalent so we had erm convert we w- we wrote a parser erm P to G erm G to P erm parser so after that erm we now manually checked the corpus the MS Word and Open Office search and replace tools were also helped us in this so the remaining erm representations were solved by this now that's an example about ten of the phonetically balanced sentences extracted from the Festival utterance erm database actually we wrote this and then gave it to Festival so erm we had the the Ibibio corpus the a- a- actually we did it up to five times that's why you find version five and there's the first sentence so the sentence is erm prayer without ceasing bo okan kuk bamba that it was in selected from a corpus of about six
